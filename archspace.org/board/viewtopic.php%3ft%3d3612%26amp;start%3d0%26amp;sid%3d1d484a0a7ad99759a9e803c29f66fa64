				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The captain sat down in his chair by his desk, just in easy reaching distance was a drink, apparently the recipe was generally the same as from the days of the legendary earth. He chuckled to himself, he didn’t believe in any of the religious BS that went on and on about earth and true gods, hell he didn’t even believe in any god, he just wanted to go kill some alien scum, and although his current ship almost made him sick, he was doing damage to the Xesperados. He had passed through several heavily armed blockades to successfully privateer over 20 planets, he was the most successful “official” pirate, ever. his ship would pass through several blockades, they could see his ship and yet they would do nothing to stop him, they wouldn’t do anything for a long time.
<br />
The captain watched through his view ports as the pure white of hyper space faded, and became individual strands, and then the strands shortened down to individual dots, each one became a star. he moved to the front view port, and there is was, a massive blockade, over a thousand ships, each one with the express purpose of stopping his ship from taking the planets PP, but they would all fail, they would let his ship past, as if it wasn’t there, and yet they could each see it as plain as day. He could see the dreadnoughts and even a single mobile fortress in the midst; this was the largest fleet yet sent to stop them.
<br />
As his ship moved forward slowly, the ship was cooling down after the transition from hyperspace to normal space, he watched a display panel, and switched it over to incoming communications, it all looked normal, then the screen flashed red, a side bar came up, incorrect code came through the translator, damn he thought, intel had been right, he brought up and reinstalled the second newer set of codes
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
still going....
<br />

<br />
feedback?
<br />

<br />
yes the storyline is thought out, sorta  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
second part:
<br />
They worked, he sighed, his ship was safe, for now.
<br />
He looked out at the nacelles, they’re cooling grilles were glowing white hot, from the massive energy that was being leaked of them, the left over energy from the transition to normal space, of course human engines were much more efficient, but they had to look authentic, and hence, very inefficient hyperspace engines.
<br />
His ship almost slid through space, the engines made almost no tremor and noise through the ships hull, for that he was glad, he hated going to sleep on his old ship, whose engines would make the whole ship shake when they were activated.
<br />
He looked out his forward window, and the blockade loomed of the front of his ship, he could see all of the ships there now with more clarity, it was almost a task force that could withstand a magistrate attack, several dreadnoughts, all with some form of advanced weapons by the looks of it, he walked back the display panel, and pulled up the comn window, and put a call through to the sensors station on the bridge.
<br />
“yes captain” came a clear crisp voice over the comn
<br />
“take a look at the dreadnought weapons, I think they’ve made a new advancement, I think it would be an idea to send all info that we can get on them back to HQ when we finish this run” he said
<br />
“Yes sir, I just noticed them myself, taking scans now…. And done, yes sir, it appears to be a new form of missile, taking passive scans now for HQ”
<br />
“In fact ensign, take scans of all the ships you can, and formations, I want to know what these guys have that we don’t” 
<br />
“That could take some time sir, but I will do my best” came the call back, the captain sighed, and sat down again, and his ship slid into the planets atmosphere…
<br />

<br />
As he watched the front of his ship began to glow red, it was then, in the cloud layer that the Xesperados so loved, that they activated they’re cloaking, he watched as first he seemed to disappear, and then, the reality field, which kept reality normal within the ship, so they could see themselves, and they’re hands, and command consoles.
<br />
He always hated that part, then he couldn’t even see his own hands, but he didn’t want to try bringing the reality field online before the cloaking field came online, those ships were never seen again, and the few that were told tales of horrible sites, and extra dimensions, he shuddered, he didn’t want to have to go through that, ever.
<br />
He walked to his lift, and went up to the bridge, and made a comn call to have they prisoner taken, and hooked up to ‘the chair’, he smiled, as he thought of the trouble they were causing to the Xesperados economy.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
btw, these guys are human, the captain is at least, and no im not spoiling the story for all of you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />  it is going somewere
<br />

<br />
third part, not quiet a part, but i cant save it atm (dont ask why0 so here it is....
<br />

<br />

<br />
he made it to the bridge, and looked out over the main view screens, he could see the Xesperados capital... he waited, and slowly information began flooding from the chair, the captaives mind was being picked for all the information it had on the captial... suddenly a building highlighted, and the ship changed course for it.
<br />
"prepare the away team to go and steal all of theyre money now"
<br />
"yes sir" said his first officer, and he went of to the ready room to begin preperations for the first away team. the captian looked out as the ship moved slowly through the thick air of the xesperados core planet, they were moving towards the planets biggest bank by the looks of it... he studied the pannel that was linked to the chair.
<br />
a gastly device was the chair, because theyre computers couldnt store a entire brains memorys, the computer must use the persons brain as storage space, and although for the first few times it has no lasting side effects, but after that the person in question began to suffer from an old human disorder, although the captain couldnt recal the name of it, it made the person to lose therye memorys, and become out of sync with reality, and as such had been out lawed for use on humans, xesperados however...
<br />
he watched as the chair began to identify different important, and rich buildings based upon theyre architechure, and the captain began identifying several buildings as targets in additions to theyre current building that theyre were heading towards. he sent the buildings over to the ready room, for the away team to study.
<br />
"sir, we are hovering over the building, preparing for deployment, away team eta is 15 minutes, we are working on the pod now to send them of in"
<br />
the pods, an interesting peice of technology, they had cloaking devices, but could change the colour of theyre outer plating to any, so that it could de cloak when attached to a building, without arousing suspision.
<br />
"ok, tell them to take theyre time, i want this done properly... and efficiently" said the captain, in response to the young ensigns report.<br />_________________<br /></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">"Those who abandon their friends are worse than trash" - Uchiha Obito </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
He looked out at the nacelles, they’re cooling grilles were glowing white hot, from the massive energy that was being leaked of them, the left over energy from the transition to normal space, of course human engines were much more efficient, but they had to look authentic, and hence, very inefficient hyperspace engines.
<br />
His ship almost slid through space, the engines made almost no tremor and noise through the ships hull, for that he was glad, he hated going to sleep on his old ship, whose engines would make the whole ship shake when they were activated.
<br />
He looked out his forward window, and the blockade loomed of the front of his ship, he could see all of the ships there now with more clarity, it was almost a task force that could withstand a magistrate attack, several dreadnoughts, all with some form of advanced weapons by the looks of it, he walked back the display panel, and pulled up the comn window, and put a call through to the sensors station on the bridge.
<br />
“yes captain” came a clear crisp voice over the comn
<br />
“take a look at the dreadnought weapons, I think they’ve made a new advancement, I think it would be an idea to send all info that we can get on them back to HQ when we finish this run” he said
<br />
“Yes sir, I just noticed them myself, taking scans now…. And done, yes sir, it appears to be a new form of missile, taking passive scans now for HQ”
<br />
“In fact ensign, take scans of all the ships you can, and formations, I want to know what these guys have that we don’t” 
<br />
“That could take some time sir, but I will do my best” came the call back, the captain sighed, and sat down again, and his ship slid into the planets atmosphere…
<br />

<br />
As he watched the front of his ship began to glow red, it was then, in the cloud layer that the Xesperados so loved, that they activated they’re cloaking, he watched as first he seemed to disappear, and then, the reality field, which kept reality normal within the ship, so they could see themselves, and they’re hands, and command consoles.
<br />
He always hated that part, then he couldn’t even see his own hands, but he didn’t want to try bringing the reality field online before the cloaking field came online, those ships were never seen again, and the few that were told tales of horrible sites, and extra dimensions, he shuddered, he didn’t want to have to go through that, ever.
<br />
He walked to his lift, and went up to the bridge, and made a comn call to have they prisoner taken, and hooked up to ‘the chair’, he smiled, as he thought of the trouble they were causing to the Xesperados economy.
<br />

<br />

<br />

btw, these guys are human, the captain is at least, and no im not spoiling the story for all of you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />  it is going somewere<br />_________________<br /></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">"Those who abandon their friends are worse than trash" - Uchiha Obito </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
