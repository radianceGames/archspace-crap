I don't watch Star Trek and have only seen like one full episode of it in my entire life.
<br />

<br />
The last time I've seen Star Wars was probably four years ago, and I haven't seen Episode 3 yet.
<br />

<br />
I don't reall enjoy star wars video games, or any other space-related games.
<br />

<br />
Archspace is the <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> space-related game I enjoy so my knowledge of space stuff is limited to cloaking devices and Nahodoom rays, ANNNND I play DnD and love LOTR.  That being said, please forgive my noobishness at writing a space-related story.  I'm clearly more of a sword vs dragon kind of guy.

			Prologue: A Lecture on Things
<br />

<br />
	“A known and accepted characteristic that the humans of planet Earth exhibited happened to be their unhindered consumption of the planet’s resources.  From the days that they became advanced enough to colonize every square foot of the planet all the way up to the time just before their “Apocalypse,” this characteristic was connected to the race.  But was any of it true?  The advanced politics of humanity led to arguments on both sides.  As the more conservative humans saw it, the Earth was fine.  Overpopulation was a myth, and there were enough resources to last the human race for hundreds of years.  But on the other hand, the more liberal view foresaw the human race’s impending doom for these very reasons.
<br />
	“But this cleavage did not only exist as far as the resources and size of the planet went.  Because of differing views, humans were never unified for long periods of time.  The various factions of the planet, known as countries, all had their own views on how the Earth should be run.  The differing views led to great conflicts which often ended in a mass bloodshed.  Although alliances were formed for intervals of the planet’s history, they did not last long enough nor were they large enough to guarantee the race’s survival.  Therefore it is logical to assume that humanity was in a state of perpetual civil war, an archaic trait that most known races have successfully overcome.
<br />
	“The race was never unified enough to work to its full potential, but each individual faction managed to get minimal work done.  Space travel was achieved, new planets were found, and astronauts, the name for a human trained to pilot a spacecraft, became heroes.  Had each faction decided to share its technology and work together as a whole, the humans would have been more prepared for the challenge and doom that awaited them.  Instead, the factions engaged in a space race to see whose research proved to be more efficient.  
<br />
	“Contrary to popular belief, however, the humans were not technologically advanced at all.  Though many myths hold that the human race had an effective steady increase in technology, it did indeed lack this.  Studies have shown that two of the planet’s most potent factions, the United States and the Soviet Union, had achieved weapons only as advanced as the fusion missile, or hydrogen bomb, as they called it.  This occurred during the period of time on Earth known as the Cold War which, in human chronology, began in 1945 and ended in 1990.  It was not a war per se, for it was fought mostly through psychological means and deterrence.  Each side engaged in an “arms race” to build weapons faster than the other.  But the premise of the war goes on to support the disunity between the human race and the animosity between its various factions.  
<br />
	“As is clearly evidenced, no human was ever able to completely unify the human race.  That does not go to say that no human ever tried.  Some of the more momentous humans who attempted this great feat were always regarded as villains because of their radical views regarding the way in which the Earth should and would have been ruled under their power.  Though under the recent trauma that the race and its planet have suffered, it is arguable whether or not the ideals of those dictators, as they were called, would seem as pejorative in the long run as the humans perceived during their lifetimes.
<br />
	“Thus, unification among the human race was nonexistent.  Every faction on the planet had, at one time or another, more power than the others.  But no single faction’s reign lasted very long.  Opinions regarding resources were so dissimilar that no logical decisions on how to proceed in that area were ever made.  Research amongst the humans was also ineffective and phlegmatic.  If they had tackled that aspect of life as a team rather than having each faction use it to gain power over the others, they would have advanced much further and would have been a less subordinate force against their oppressors, our greatest foe, and now theirs as well.
<br />
	“However, it must be noted that the reasoning for this disunity amongst their race cannot be accredited to its supposed lust for power as much as it can be tied to its overall ignorance. Although no historian can say for certain, it has often been stated, in pure supposition of course, that had humans been more aware of their galaxy and the various races within it, they would have formed more of a pact amongst themselves for protection and efficient organization.  The humans did take steps to educate themselves in this area with their various space programs.  But again, each faction had its own space program, thus tying back to the initial point of disunity.  If humankind fused together in at least this one aspect of its existence, it may have been able to make contact sooner and thus fuse together as a whole, giving it obvious benefits.
<br />
	“But we all know the fate of Earth and the humans.  If it had not been for our constant surveillance of the Xeloss, then their successful surprise siege against Earth would have lasted long enough for them to have enslaved and slaughtered the greater population of humans.  Currently the planet Earth is under our control; it is safe to assume that the Xeloss have been planning a counterattack against us for some time now.  But there is no need to worry, for we have mastered a ship component that can effectively block the Xeloss’ primary weapon.
<br />
	“After many years of attempting to terraform the planet into something useful to us and failing, the Grand Council speaker has decided that Earth is a lost cause.  Recently, a decree has been passed ordering the transfer of its inhabitants to a more suitable planet under our control, and, ultimately, the planet’s destruction.  Teams have already been sent out to plant the negation charges within Earth’s core.  As you should know from your reading, a negation charge releases concentrated anti-matter directly into the core of a planet, causing the core to effectively become “negated” into non-existence.  This in turn immediately alters the ecosystem of the planet, causing an almost instantaneous death of all life due to the severe imbalance and instability that results.  The planet then collapses into itself in an attempt to recreate its core and stabilize, but with each charge that is set off within the core, the planet slowly collapses into a void.  Regardless of your political views on the matter, I insist that you remain silent.
<br />
	“Naturally, the humans are vehemently opposed to this decree.  But at long last they seem to be able to finally agree on something as a race.  This flabbergasting breakthrough is only the first of many that need to take place before the humans can endeavor to survive in the galaxy on their own.  We hope that in the future, such drastic measures will be avoided to wholly unite their race.
<br />
	“Within a few days, we should be receiving word of Earth’s obliteration from the teams deployed by the Grand Council.  We can only hope that the pathetic past of the humans will be obliterated with the decaying remains of the planet as well.  That concludes today’s lecture.  I suggest that you all download the new information onto your memory chips.  That concludes today’s lecture.”
<br />
	After concluding his lecture, Commander Azdgari sat down at his desk and dismissed the class.  The students removed their memory chips from their desk computers and headed for the door.  However, as every class tended to be blessed by the presence of a particularly curious mind, one student approached her instructor to speak further about Earth’s auto-destruction.  She always stayed after class to garner whatever extra bits of information she could from Commander Azdgari.  After all, she was a very wise girl, and she knew she could learn a lot from him.  Her friends had recently thought up a nickname for her, Lady Dragon, for according to human stories, dragons were wise, powerful creatures of fairytale
<br />
	He looked up and curled his lip kindly as she approached.  “Well I certainly wasn’t expecting to see you after class today, ‘Lady Dragon’,” he remarked sarcastically.
<br />
	She chuckled and replied, “Well, I was just curious...”
<br />
	“As usual.”
<br />
	“Well of course.  Sir, if you don’t mind my asking, what are your views on Earth’s destruction?  Personally <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> find it to be a horrible decision.”
<br />
	The commander’s smile faded and he shook his head sadly.  “Yes, Miss Dragon, horribly necessary.”<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q13/LMA11/strecthyleet.jpg" border="0" />

Anyway Leet, your story's pretty cool.  You do a good job in not revealing your point of view on the topic of humans and earth and w/e....well, the NARRATOR'S point of view, which would then be Azdgari.  Is there gonna be more?<br />_________________<br /><span style="color: red"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">I put the romance back in necromancer.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Very interesting story.  I do find it rather...odd?...that you attempt to define the so called "discontinuity" of the human race as it's only downfall.  You do however attempt to bring into the fold of your work a sort of brief "human history".  However you do neglect to bring in several key components that are paramount to human history up to this point in time.  You have completely ignored the system of technological alliances current in place between the USA, Russia, Japan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Great Britain, Singapore, Germany, Italy, France, Mexico, etc. etc. etc.  Mostly due to NAFTA (regardless of its current hinderances it still manages to accomplish a sharing of information none the less) (and yes I know Singapore and the rest of Asia are NOT part of NAFTA!).
<br />

<br />
You also do not seem to bring to realization that your "assault on human kind" by the Xellos takes place in a time in the "future" of humanity.  If you are using Archspace as a means of "technological comparison" humanity has already managed to acclimate a variety of technological advancements into its arsenal.  
<br />

<br />
If you have so chosen to ignore this facet of Archspace, which honestly would appear to make since in the context of which you have written this, would not the basic human instinct of survival have led to war against the unnamed conquerers of Earth?  Would not the human race rise up against their "mysterious benefactors"?  For some reason I am fondly reminded of Battlefield Earth by L. Ron Hubbard (the book NOT the movie).
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you should pick up a copy of that as your story seems to play out as if the "Psyclos" are teaching a class.
<br />

<br />
Alas I have babbled enough and perhaps should actually comment on the literary aspects of your piece.
<br />

<br />
Before delving directly into your intense one sided dialogue perhaps you should "set the stage"?  A prologue typically is introduced as a means to explain in some manner the reason WHY they should read your piece, and the reason WHY you wrote your work in the first place. 
<br />

<br />
As an educator, and a novice author of "The Azguard Chronicles" (which are being updated and expanded by the way <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ), your use of dialoge does not accurately portray what one would find in a classroom.  You completely neglect the fact there is someone(s) in the "classroom" until near the end when you quickly tell them not to voice their opinions when you do not even illustrate that someone has wanted to speak in the first place! OR that someone else is even in the room up to this point!
<br />

<br />
On the other hand I do rather enjoy your use of various aspects of current human history to explain why, in our current state in 2006, we would suck ass when faced with global domination by a species from outer space.  I also enjoyed the back story which was garnished with a one sided dialogue.
<br />

<br />
Perpahs this would have been better as a back story? Or if presenting it as a class you establish the atmosphere in which it should be set?  
<br />

<br />
I look forwared to more <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
