My fellow Valhallans have failed me, since I have yet to get a reply to my stories on VH forums, and I posted them December 18th.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

<br />

<br />
I first made contact with Vyarmi in my garden-place. He was seeking comfort while I was seeking company, so we found solace in each other.
<br />

<br />
I had been deep in thought, contemplating a magenta tulip, when he appeared at the gate. I opened it with a flick of my wrist and in he walked. Coming to a stop at the foot of the giant maple tree with pink and yellow foliage, he examined my garden-place. He raised his hand in the traditional dream-salute, index and middle fingers and ring and pinkie pressed together, forming a v. I returned the guesture and rose to stand facing him across the bed of multicoloured roses.
<br />

<br />
We studied each other. On the surface, he was 7 feet tall, broad, muscular, with extremely long blue and purple hair streaming out behind and above his head and deep green robes with electric currents running through them. Inside, though, I could sense an immense sadness, and a deep loneliness. He needed someone to touch minds with.
<br />

<br />
I don’t know how much he sensed of my identical sadness and loneliness, but he saw a 5-foot tall, scantily clad, golden skinned voluptuous female, with orange hair cut close to the scalp and 6 inch long silver nails. After a timelessly short interval, we both broke into huge grins and settled down in the lotus position in mid-air.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">What brings you to my realm?</span> I asked him, lowering my eyelashes sexily. <span style="font-style: italic">Looking for company?</span> I allowed a merry twinkle to show in my eyes and watched the corners of his mouth twitch upwards ever so slightly. He knew that I was fully aware of how he felt and what he was looking for.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I seek comfort in a friend.</span> He replied. <span style="font-style: italic">I’ve yet to find one true enough that I may unburden my heart of its pain. Perhaps you could help me there. Are you a true friend, Dheline?</span>
<br />

<br />
I gasped at the use of my name. I had not told him what it was. He should not have been able to pick it out of my thoughts, yet somehow he knew it.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">What form of power do you have that you can find my true name? How do you know it?</span>
<br />

<br />
He considered the question for a moment, clasping his hands and twining his fingers together while deep in thought. Locking eyes with me, his lips again twitched in that almost-smile.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">How do you hear the song of the birds you have imagined and thereby created?</span> He asked as a starling trilled its song. <span style="font-style: italic">I don’t know how I see your name; I know it. It is not such a great achievement. You could see my name, if you felt for it.</span>
<br />

<br />
I pursed my lips in a careful frown and closed my eyes. Reaching out with my mind, I found his and carefully probed the surface. I sensed laughter as he felt the gentle tickle of my presence in his head. Suppressing a minor twinge of irritation, I plunged deep into his thoughts. Testing the ‘air’, I felt for a name to the confusing, ever changing kaleidoscope of images and feelings that ran through his mind. Feeling a faint whisper, I followed it to the very core of his being. There, I poised on the brink of a great well of loneliness and looked down into the darkness. There, I saw his name. Extricating myself from it all in a split second and returning to my own body, I opened my eyes slowly.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Vyarmi,</span> I named him, trying not to shout my triumph.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Dheline,</span> He smiled at me, and I returned his grin.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
This one's more of a character description...
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Shai’in</span></span>
<br />

<br />
She was naked, her only adornment dozens of chains of gold around her neck, legs and arms, and wound through her mesmerizing hair. Her hair was all the colours of the ocean and sky, from deep azure blue to pale aqua to light, mourning green, from periwinkle to stormy grey to deep night’s blue-black. Her eyes, one emerald green the other bright white, shone with wisdom and pain, yet also strength and viciousness. Her lips were pale blue, her teeth slightly gold. Her skin was almost translucent, a pale gold colour with streaks of copper fire.
<br />

<br />
Slung low around her waist were two sheaths each containing a beautiful but deadly silver dagger with fire opals set into the hilts. When she moved it was with the grace and speed of a swallow, and when she attacked it was with the ferocity and efficiency of a tiger shark, lean muscles rippling under her gold-and-copper flesh.
<br />

<br />
Her name was Shai’in, and she was Queen of Sea and Sky, keeper of the wind and waves.
<br />

<br />
She was Shai’in, the Queen of Sea and Sky, and she was alone.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Once upon a time...</span></span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
Once upon a time there was a young woman. She felt beautiful and pretty, but she was sad because no one else seemed to think so. She tried not to be shallow and vain, but deep down inside she was terribly full of pride. She wanted to make men turn their heads and gape at her beauty. She wanted to make women envious of her stunning looks. She at least wanted someone every once in a while to somehow indicate that she was attractive. She felt like the Ugly Duckling with the Swan inside- feeling great but also feeling like no one else sees the beauty. She felt completely unattractive.
<br />

<br />
But of course she couldn’t let anyone know how insecure she was about how she was seen, so she acted confident in the effect her looks had (or didn’t have). She flaunted her body, completely comfortable with it. She yearned to be desired by everyone, but barely got a second glance, ever. Even though she knew she wasn’t, she felt ugly. The young woman felt ugly, and her inner beauty slowly faded and died as her confidence crumbled. Then finally, one day, she knew the truth: she really was ugly.<br />_________________<br />A.K.A.

I don't have anything written, but I guess I could write some more and use what I have as a prologue or intro or something... but my problem is I need a good chunk of time to get writing done, and I'm at school 8 or 9-7 every day except Friday when I'm off at 1, and too tired to do anything beyond bumming around on the comp. So if I ever get inspired and energized to write, I'll check out writing more with Shai'in.<br />_________________<br />A.K.A. Girl

<br />
Your storytelling is quite like H.P. Lovecraft(description) or Tolkien (because of the details)
<br />
And the athmosphere reminds me of Salvatore, somehow...(maybe I just pictured the characters as elves or smth, thoug not dark complexion <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
These are just the first feelings after reading...
<br />

<br />
I may not be a qualified critic as im not a native english speaker, but that`s why Í pay more attention to the whole atmosphere and "nyans" of the story.
<br />

<br />
You should write longer stories, first one sounded like it could be an extract of a longer story(maybe still in your mind! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I am a lazy writer myself and maybe too critical("perfectionist"), that`s why I, personally, don`t get much done...
<br />

<br />
Anyway good work and would love to see more.<br />_________________<br />"Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
