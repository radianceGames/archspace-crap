<br />

<br />
      Philosophy of freedom is the crime of this beautiful nation of ours. Philosophy = freedom, freedom = crime, crime is an offense against society. Philosophy is a freedom that is entitled to all, no matter how oppressed you may be, they cannot read your mind. Freedom is a crime, because freedom is one person going about, greedily thinking about themselves and not the best yield of the whole. And crime is an offense against society, one or many persons going against the way of society regardless of what good it may or may not do. Thus freedom is a crime, and philosophy is a crime as well. Although freedom is obtained through thought, and philosophy is a thought, philosophy is a belief that cannot be taken away, but is a crime, if pursued by one (or group of ones). 
<br />

<br />
      Does that mean that philosophy is to be punished? And if so, how do you go about punishing the world of a single shared thought? Do they sit in on every conversation of every person in the entire world, on every millisecond, of every day, of every week, of every year? And, how would one regulate such a crime as thought? Who is to blame a “free” person for thinking and sharing their thought? Do you punish gossip? Who has the right to regulate the entitlement to chose what is just and unjust?
<br />

<br />
      This beautiful country of ours, that we so willingly submit to, is called a country of freedom. What freedom? A lot of great writers are being banned from schools, because their writings are “abnormal.” Define for me abnormal! Abnormal is what scares you because you know that they are the ones who think for themselves. They know justice, and later on in life we realize this after they are dead and cannot direct us were we should be going. For instance, Edgar Allan Poe was noted as a crazy man that had grotesque stories with no moral to them, but a few years after he died the world started to realize what the stories truthfully meant, and now he can’t help us to change our ways. 
<br />

<br />
      Now we need not say that we need anarchy. Anarchy just leads us in a giant circle that leads us back to the beginning, again. This is the last thing that we need. This causes panic and entities to fear for their lives. This is the last thing that we need, mobs of cacophony running about, like choir without its director. The point is that we need leaders. Even in anarchy leaders would end up flourishing, causing republics, monarchies and all over war for the allotted land that was left. The people would become like viruses feeding off each other to sustain the needed power to feed themselves, and if this includes death to the host (our beautiful country) then so be it. 
<br />

<br />
      The point is that we just need to re-evaluate our ruling system every century. The world changes and as the world changes we need to do the same. Our leaders “amend” the constitution all the time, but usually they don not change to much themselves. This beautiful country of ours has had the same type of leaders since it was created. All of them are Anglo-Saxon descent males, that are straight and that base all of their beliefs off of one religion. Some say, “that is okay because they are unified under one god,” but it is not okay. Is it okay for almost all of them have sexual relationships with their secretaries and slaves? Did you know that Abraham Lincoln had an affair with a few of his own slaves, but yet opposed slavery? Just another marketing tool for leaders to gain the upper hand on their opponent. Time for diversity to take its proper path.
<br />

<br />
      Now diversity, we cannot have that in the white house but can in the schools and work places of this world? If we can have these “clicks” in school, then why cannot we have them in the white house? These clicks overtake our schools taking over all reasonable thought, which may or may not be philosophy. They allow for some to take away the potency to speak out and throw them down, to scare them into not thinking nor speaking. This is not a new thing either. Surely Edgar Alan Poe was thrown down by someone like “honest” Abe. Just another entity trying to escape to the top of society, even if this includes the hope of millions to be piled up underneath him to be used like a dump of bodies to save one out of a prison. This is a crime, and supposedly “freedom” and “justice.” Will you stand for this, knowing that your child is either trying to escape the truth or being maimed for his words of truth? 
<br />

<br />
      One once said, “To cut something, a sharp instrument is required; and to cut the mind from its attachments, sharp words are often required.” This means that strong words are needed to bring about change to the world. We are scared of change because its mysteriously unknown. This “unknown” is not within the safety blanket of most so it is considered to be a bad thing, even if it brings forth the turn of the century and truthfully liberates the nation of its ignorance. This unknown is the thing that hinders the true freedom and we need to liberate this beautiful nation of this virus that hiders it so. The nation is on the brink of a tremendous clash that will plunge us into complete and total darkness that will corrupt our nation to a new degree that is only heard of in the monarchs of the nations that we have fought against for so many years that ultimately has corrupted. All of this nations past could have been nothing but a squander, like a planet trying to survive a black hole or a super nova.
<br />

<br />
      This beautiful nation of ours uses the idea of a safety blanket that over takes the nation so that it can only see what it wants to. Sometimes we need to see more than we see. This safety blanket of our beautiful nation causes us to be thwarted by it, causing us to lose the pure thought that we some much see in the youth of the children. this pure thought is the thought of philosophy, perhaps the purest form of philosophy. Should we leave it alone and watch it boil up under us, so that we have to go to a nursing home or insane asylum for such crazy thoughts that “should” only be thought by a young one? Perhaps we should listen to the children that surround us on thought about the nation and world. Perhaps we should teach our children to “think outside the box,” or rather be creative. Perhaps this will demolish this safety blanket problem of ours.
<br />

<br />
      We allow for this beautiful nation of ours to regulate laws that cause a safety blanket. For instance, homosexuals are not allowed to marry. But why? Their reasoning behind this is that it interrupts the sanctity of marriage and causes for less children to be born. First of all this “sanctity” has never existed. This nation is obsessed with the idea of divorce as an escape to an “unwanted marriage.” Is this the sanctity of marriage that we so ignorantly try to “save?” Second of all, the issue of homosexuals not having children because they are not marred to a mate of the divergent gender, LIES! Even if we do not allow for these homosexuals to marry, they still are going to be homosexuals. In addition to this, we already have a over population problem.
<br />

<br />
      We use religion as a safety blanket. We use religion where we find it necessary, and edit it to our likings. Is this what the “gods” and “goddesses” that we worship so much want us to do. Changing “their words” to our likings, so that we can oppress others but not be oppressed by others. This is not what religion is to be used for. It is rather a guideline for life for us to use, not everyone around us to be oppressed by. We uses religion to shield ourselves from the nature of this world, like a valiant knight shielding himself from the fiery flare of a dominating dragon.
<br />

<br />
      But religion does keep this beautiful nation of ours staggering ignorant baboons at bay from creating the oppression that they could. If religion didn’t exist then the ignorant entities of this beautiful nation of ours would have no reason to hold back on discriminating against the mentally stronger. Since the beginning of time the physically strong has always tried to oppress the mentally strong to “keep them in their place.” It is time to take our proper place as the rulers and create the justice that we were meant to take, and rule over the ignorant and obtuse. Religion has held them back, now it is time for us to take advantage of our ancestors’ creations. Take hold of this work of art and unify our people, both ignorant and intelligent living under one house, peacefully. Time for the strengths of both physical and mental to rule as one instead of divided.
<br />

<br />
      If you believe in something then it is not a religion. Religion comes from the Latin word relig&#257;re, which translated is the verb for to tie or hold down. This would incorporate that religion is to tie down generations to generations of ancestors to the same beliefs, which causes them not to be able to think on their own. Thus this religion is what one is forced into believing, not what one (sub-consciously) believes in. Is this religion a type of freedom, or a strong hold for the ignorant; being used to hold down their superiorly intelligent brethrens, enabling them to climb above them, and in turn reigning over them? 
<br />

<br />
      Religion is an entanglement, that is used for the previous generation to hold down the past generation. Because of religion, the older generation is able to turn up revenue (or rather the money). A prime example of this is the “all-inclusive” and “dutiful ” Pope himself. The Pope is the leader of the Catholics, (which according to) says that they must pay their monthly “dues” to God, Christ and the Virgin Mary. This is the problem with society today; all we want is money and the power like visualization of it. Even the “holiest” of man-kind today is overly obsessed with the periling nets if money. Is this just for one to say that money is “the root of all evil,” then hypocritically take that very same money as a “good offering” towards his own self investments?
<br />

<br />
      It isn’t the money that is evil, but rather the entities that back it up that are. We say we are freed from the world, but sense this beautiful nation of ours is a capitalistic one, we are not able to sustain freedom from the world of commercials and advertising. When I think of this I think of two main quotes from the movie Fight Club as said by Brad Pitt: “ The things that we own, end up owning us,” and ““Man I seen in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived. I see all this potential and I see a squander. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables. Slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, to buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose, no place. We have no great war, no great depression; our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we will all be millionaires, and movie gods and rock stars, but we won’t. We’re slowly learning that fact, and were very, very pissed off.” These two things combined tell me that we do realize the trouble that we are in as a purely capitalistic nation. This beautiful nation of ours is in a trouble of realizing sub-consciously but not awakening this fact. We just follow the leader, unaware that we don’t need, or want, a lot of the things that we buy and have. We need to seek out this problem and re-amend it, not reincarnate it as we submit to doing so easily, time and time again.
<br />

<br />
      Now we need not say that we need to fully rid this beautiful nation of ours of money, nor fully embrace it, but rather to amend the use and ways of money. As we fully use the world of money we need not forget that we are the ones in charge of it, not the ones that we “admire.” We need not to use the ways and objects of others to embrace them, ultimately creating the power that they “possess,” but rather strip them of their power and take that power in which is yours. Whether you use some one else to talk directly for you, or talk for yourself, they need not the power that we submit to. The over all point is that we need to create a certain harmony in the greed and chaos of this beautiful nation of ours, making sure not to embrace neither to much. We need all aspects to sustain “order.” As violence is related to peace, chaos and order closely follow. Most importantly, we need to create a good balance between revenue communism and money dictatorship.<br />_________________<br /><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal">"ARS|LONGA|VITA|BREVIS"</span>
