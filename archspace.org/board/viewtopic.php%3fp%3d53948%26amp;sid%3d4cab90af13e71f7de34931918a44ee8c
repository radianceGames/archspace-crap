<br />
This is medieval fantasy-ish one:
<br />

<br />
The Mayday Joust…
<br />
…the perfect time of year to display one’s talents (or lack thereof) before the capital of the empire; it was a time of celebration, of victories on and off the battlefield. But it was also a time of deceit and or great treachery – as many of the competitors were soon to discover; Claudius Aemillianus, for instance, would soon come to realise that not all lances were blunt at the tips… 
<br />
The charming violet eyed captain of the Empirical Guard – though new to this world of jousting and duelling – was already becoming a favourite among lords and ladies alike and was greeted by the roar of the crowd as he readied himself for battle. 
<br />
The flag was waved and the combatants began to charge at one another at full speed, pushing both themselves and their horses to the limits, each for one’s own cause: perhaps for the price, the recognition, to win the heart of that special spectator amidst the crowd or simply for the sheer joy of battle. But whatever the cause, ends perhaps could never truly justify the means. 
<br />
Claudius was focusing hard at the point of contact he had chosen but through the small slits in the visor it was difficult to keep his eyes while on it riding at such a speed.
<br />
 His opponent was approaching... 
<br />
Several feet… 
<br />
Several inches…
<br />
 
<br />
There was a dull thud as the men landed a blow to one another, but neither fell. The captain felt a sharp pain in his right shoulder for an instant at he was hit but carried on at his murderous pace as the two men charged towards the end of the fence that separated them. Less than a second later, there was a sickening snap of wood as his opponents lance snapped near the tip; splinters of wood and chips of paint flying everywhere.   
<br />
The wounded captain was full of curses as his horse reached the end of the fence, whereon he tore of his helmet and threw it aside in rage. Claudius bit his lip hard then reached for the large bloody wooden splint and removed it from his throbbing right shoulder. “He tipped it…” the weapons master muttered as he took the lance from Claudius.
<br />
“The nerve of the little…” he growled under his breath, “Find me a lighter lance.” 
<br />
The old man shook his head, “Sir…you should dismount now and report the incident; you can’t carry on like this –”  
<br />
“No!” Claudius snapped, “I can’t allow scum like him to win this tournament…” he paused, “who would listen?! The lords can bribe their way out of humiliation but as for me, I have no such luck. I must carry on…”
<br />
The weapons master sighed, “As you wish sir…” he muttered as he handed the captain another lance. Claudius clenched the six foot long piece of wood in his hand, then dropped, “I can’t…” he muttered, flexing his gloved fingers.
<br />
“This is the lightest one I have, Sir.”
<br />
Claudius sighed and thought for a moment, he hadn’t much time before the next run, if he was to forfeit, he may as well do it now. “Tie it to my arm…”
<br />
“Sir –”
<br />
He sighed, “Just do it…there isn’t much time”
<br />

<br />
Claudius could imagine his opponent laughing at him and though he couldn’t see the look on his face through their visors – it must have been one of malice. He inhaled deeply and braced himself for the second run. The flag was raised and dropped, and just as before the men lowered their weapons and charged. These few moments between, for Claudius, were reduced to the sound of pounding hoof beats and the blood in his ears; his mind was consumed with the thought of spilling the little bastard’s blood.
<br />
Three…
<br />
Two…
<br />
One… And die!!! He thought quietly to himself as the side of his lance hit his opponent in the chest, knocking the man backwards off his horse, almost. Claudius watched with great satisfaction as his opponent was dragged toward the other end of the arena; dangling from his horse by the shin greave that had caught in the stirrup. 
<br />
The crowd roared with approval and many silk kerchiefs and flowers were thrown his way as he dismounted his horse. And for a moment, he allowed himself to bask in the warmth of the adoration of the spectators, many of whom were commoners just as he, before marching off to the armoury to change into more comfortable clothing. 
<br />
Claudius breathed a sigh of relief as he sat down on the hard wooden bench next to supply; relieved that he had won, relatively unscathed but more so because he had defeated the cheating nobleman by willpower and not deceit. He knew well that the tipped lance was no accident; it was meant for him. Being one of the few ranking commoners in the Empirical Guard, whom, at the Emperor’s grace were allowed entry into this year Mayday Joust, he was well aware of the fact that he would be subject to ruthless and unfair treatment. 
<br />
 “Ah! There you are!”
<br />
He turned around to see his commanding officer, the retired General Augustus, standing at the threshold with a handsome young man Claudius had never seen before. Claudius immediately got to his feet, clicked his heels and saluted. Augustus and the other man returned the gesture then approached.
<br />
“Claudius, this is your new commander whom I’ve spoken so much of late, the honourable General Marcius Nero Camillus, son of the Duke of Versailles.”
<br />
The captain saluted again, “It is an honour sir” he muttered with false enthusiasm. August had spoken for months about dispatching Claudius and his men elsewhere to train recruits with another general. He’d always thought of it as nothing but nonsense and now the day has come, Claudius was sure – as he had forever been – that he didn’t want to leave his comfortable position in the Empirical Guard to live in barracks with the regulars. 
<br />
“General Camillus will –”
<br />
“Captain, you’re bleeding!”
<br />
Claudius glanced at his shoulder and the blood running down the shiny metal of his breastplate, “It’s…nothing…” he stammered.
<br />
“I’m sure that it is nothing serious, Captain Aemillianus is a medic and is quite capable of caring for himself” Augustus muttered as he began to walk off, his new commander gave Claudius another anxious look before following the old man outside. The captain breathed a sigh of relief as he unfastened and set aside his armour – his shoulder was throbbing, but he couldn’t treat himself here: there were far too many people walking about and furthermore he was lacking the necessary tools.  
<br />
He stalked out of one of the arena, and though much of the city was taking part in the tournament, there were still many who were busy buying and trading in the crowded streets. Claudius glanced here and there; making several stops along the way before returning to his quarters at the top of the Eastern guard tower. 
<br />

<br />
Sitting amongst the lords and ladies of one of the high tables, Claudius felt strangely out of place. He felt belittled wedged between Augustus and Camillus and all the more so as he glanced across the table at those around him. 
<br />
Though he felt quite presentable in uniform, knee length riding boots with a black velvet cape draped over his left shoulder, his attire looked like peasants’ rags compared to the richly adorned nobility in silk and damask. And while they worn countless precious stones and pearls around their necks; dangled them from their ears and displayed them on the circlets and caps set upon their brows and on their clothes, Claudius wore only a ring around the fourth finger of his left hand.
<br />

<br />
“How is your shoulder, Captain?” Camillus asked quietly.
<br />
“Fine, thank you, sir.”
<br />
Camillus nodded, “Why did you not report that your opponent’s lance had been tipped?” he asked with a frown.
<br />
Claudius shrugged, “I did not think that anyone would listen” he replied, “Anyhow, things of this sort are not uncommon at the tournament.”
<br />
The general laughed, “A decade ago it was, but today this is a serious offence…”
<br />
“Don’t trouble yourself general” Claudius muttered, “It was nothing…”
<br />
He didn’t like this new general, under Augustus he could do as he pleased but under this new commander, who was already watching him like a hawk, Claudius had an uncanny feeling that things were going to be quite different. 
<br />
The idea of leaving suddenly became all the less appealing. 
<br />
Captain Aemillianus spent the rest of the night staring at the food before him and taking the occasional sip of wine while he listened to the conversation and gossip around him, all of which were of no interest to him. Though Camillus and Augustus made an effort to include Claudius in their conversations – they failed horribly – and by the end of the evening, the young captain was almost already fast asleep.
<br />

<br />
Claudius was hardly surprised at the reaction he received from his men in the mess hall the following morning when he told them the news. The general had given him the details of the warning order as they left the banquet hall. Claudius and his men were to make the fortnight long trek from the capital to the northern province of Cytheira.  
<br />
“Captain…this isn’t very amusing,” one of the lieutenants muttered, “Please tell us that you were only poking fun…”
<br />
He shook his head, “That was the order” he said patiently, “we are leaving in five days for the Sethlans…”
<br />
“You mean the mountains in that frozen wasteland of a province?” one of the men snapped, “I refuse to go…”
<br />
Claudius laughed, “First of all. It’s only cold in the winter and second of all I’m not giving you a choice, Longinus…”
<br />
The men burst into laughter but some of them remained solemn, clearly disturbed by the warning order. Claudius knew well that none of his 300 men stationed here would ever want to leave their comfortable posts on the walls of Marseilles. They were well fed, well clothed and better paid than any battalion in the empire – why would anyone in their right minds have any wish to leave? 
<br />
But what troubled Claudius was the fact that Augustus had chosen to send him and his men to the Sethlans rather than that of Captain Silveira whose battalion was also stationed here as soldiers of the Empirical Guard. If Augustus truly favoured Claudius, he would have tried his hardest to keep him in Marseilles. Nevertheless, Claudius still liked to believe that it was neither his mentor’s choice nor intention to send him away and that it was the decision of Emperor Aurelius.    
<br />

<br />
Claudius returned to his quarters after the morning meal and gloomily began composing a note to his family. He had only five days and an entire battalion to ready for a long journey; there simply wasn’t enough to return home. And even if he could, he’d rather not, especially when Cassius was so cross with him.
<br />

<br />
Dear All,
<br />
Sorry for the short notice but I am leaving for the Sethlans. I haven’t the foggiest idea as to when and whether I will return. But I will write as often as I can and return home the first opportunity I have; I simply don’t have the time now.  Please take care of yourselves.
<br />
Claudius
<br />

<br />
The journey from the seaboard capital of the south to the frozen wastelands of the north lasted a little than two weeks but had felt like an eternity. First there was the storm which brought in inconceivable quantities of rain to the entire southern region for three days; everything was wet from the tents to the food. And long trek through the marshes that followed did little to improve their spirits.
<br />
Then there was the forest: days of being pestered by insects and having their food stolen by rodents. One company even had the luck of encountering a bear on their ventures to find nourishment. However, things did begin to look upward as the forest began to change and thin out.
<br />
 Broadleaved trees gave way to mixtures of deciduous and needle leafed trees but after a few days the leafed trees disappeared all together and evergreen trees were all that remained. While the environment around them improved and the tall ancient trees thinned out into dwarf-like bushes and shrubs, they encountered other problems – the lack of food and clean water. There were no streams or ponds in this drier part of the continent and though the lively vegetation consisting of a dozen different kinds of grass and a handful of bushes of sorts, there was nothing to eat.
<br />
When they finally did arrive; Claudius had never seen his men so relieved to behold snow-capped mountains or barren plains studded with moss covered rocks. It seemed foolish to think that anyone would rejoice in their arrival at such a place, but after two weeks of treacherous conditions in the wilderness, it was evident that all would gladly welcome a bed and warm food (even if it was in the middle of nowhere).
<br />
Captain Aemillianus was shown his way around the barracks by his new commander as his men were ushered into the mess hall for a lovely evening meal of dried salted pork and barely gruel. The entire place carried an air of antiquity; from the courtyard to the stone gargoyles jutting out of the walls of the soldiers’ barracks, everything was built in the likeness of century-old architecture.    
<br />
“Your men will sleep in here, forty to a room” Camillus muttered as he pushed open one of the doors in the west wing. The room stunk of mildew and rotting wood with double bunked beds lined from the front of the room to the wall at the back. Between each bunk was a small chest, or drawer for personal belonging. Claudius bit his lip, what would his men say to this?
<br />
Camillus shut the door quietly and walked on ahead and turned to face across the courtyard, “my quarters can be found there” he told Claudius then turned and walked on. Stopping at the last door in the wing he spoke again, “These are the officer’s barracks…” The captain nodded and inhaled deeply; he had been far too spoiled by Augustus – the idea of sharing quarters was unknown to him. “With my six captains, the room is full” Camillus continued, “I’ll direct you to your private quarters; it’s a little further but I’m sure you wouldn’t mind.”   
<br />

<br />
Claudius sat alone at a table, far from the other officers in the mess hall. The men had long since gone to unpack their things. Different food had been laid out for them: dried venison, cheese, bread, dried fruits and mead – all luxuries compared to the tasteless grey slush him men had been served. The food sat before Claudius, untouched, it was surprising how one’s stomach could shrink in a matter of two weeks. He busied himself instead by reading a battle tactics manual while taking occasional sips of the wine while he listened to the conversation around him.
<br />
It quickly became clear that they were unwanted here. Just my luck…Claudius thought; he’d put his men through two weeks of torture to bring them to a barren wasteland, only to be despised by the others…
<br />
“Is this seat taken?” suddenly snapping him out of his train of thought.
<br />
He looked up from his book to see a young soldier standing before him, also a captain, judging by his attire. “No.” Claudius replied then turned back to his book and eavesdropping. 
<br />
“I’m Antonius” the young man introduced himself and stuck out his hand for Claudius to shake, “pleased to meet you Captain Aemillianus”
<br />
“The honour is mine, Captain Antonius…” he muttered as they shook hands.
<br />
“How do you like it here?”
<br />
Claudius shrugged, “I’ve been here but a few hours” he said with a soft chuckle, “But I suppose it’s alright the climate here is quite different from what we are used to…”
<br />
Antonius nodded, “Your men don’t seem too pleased to be here…”
<br />
“The journey was very difficult for them – it’ll be a few days before they are… shall we say…themselves again” Claudius muttered with a forced smile. 
<br />
The other captain nodded, “Our men aren’t making matters any better are they?”
<br />
“I don’t understand, Captain Antonius” Claudius muttered.
<br />
“By the way, Captain Aemillianus, you can simply refer to me as Marcus, I see no need for such formalities” he said with a genuine smile, then went on to explain his comment, “No doubt you have heard the comments of the other captains or was perhaps even confronted with their hostility.”
<br />
Claudius shook his head, “These are your barracks and we are the invaders here, after all…” he said with a forced smile as he stood to his feet, “Enjoy your meal, Captain, I must be off now…” he muttered, clicked his heels, saluted then left.
<br />

<br />
Captain Aemillianus could hear the muttering of complaints long before he reached the theatre, where he had told his men to gather. But none of it was what he didn’t already know: the food was tasteless and bland; the states of their living quarters were atrocious and unfit for even the lowliest of livestock; their new comrades were rude and inhospitable. Claudius inhaled deeply and braced himself for a crowd of angry men as he pushed opened the door but there was nothing, only silence. The men all stood to their feet, clicked their heels in unison and saluted, “Good evening sir!”
<br />
 “This clearly, is not a good evening!” he shouted, “Men, how many times have you been told – lying before an officer is a serious offence!” Claudius snapped as he stood before them and his men burst into laughter. 
<br />
 “Let me remind you, men… Why are we here?!” he went on.
<br />
Several of them shook their heads and muttered amongst themselves.
<br />
“We came because we’re the best of the best!” he yelled, “Thus, behave like so!”
<br />
His remark was met with more mutterings of disapproval. 
<br />
Claudius sighed, “Who are we here to serve?”
<br />
“The Empire!” several men shouted in reply.
<br />
“Then why are we allowing ourselves to be trampled upon by them?!” he shouted, “Who are they to put us down? Had they been competent, the Emperor would not have sent for us! But let not your pride be your downfall. From this day forth, men, I will not tolerate another complaint.” he told them, “We are not the best merely because of the names and titles we have been given and we must show ourselves to be true soldiers of the empire – civilized and valiant!”
<br />
The men cheered and applauded this speech as Claudius clicked his heels, saluted and left the crowded theatre, feeling no more at ease then when he had entered. He was good at this; spurting lies of sorts to raise their spirits, lies which even he did not believe. He had his own theories as to why they had been sent here. 
<br />
 “Do you honestly believe what you told your men?”
<br />
Claudius was startled by the voice and turned around to see General Camillus stand several feet from him; the captain immediately clicked his heels and saluted then muttered ‘good evening’.
<br />
“Well?” Camillus sneered as he fell into step beside the young captain.
<br />
He shook his head, “Men are simple creatures; if you patronize them they will listen and if you bribe them, they will obey” he replied, “my battalion is no better than any other in this empire…”
<br />
“Then why do you think they were sent here?” Camillus asked.
<br />
 The captain laughed bitterly, “because I am young and we are dispensable, sir”
<br />
“Hmm?” the general raised an eyebrow, “I don’t quite follow…”
<br />
Claudius sighed, “Word of an uprising has reached the emperor, no doubt” he began, “Let us not keep secret amongst ourselves, general, it is evident that we were sent here to defend the north-western border; to suppress the rebellion…”
<br />
Camillus nodded, “Then I will be honest with you captain – I am here for this very reason; young and dispensable, just as you are…” he said with a sigh, “but we won’t allow ourselves to be easily disposed of will we, captain?”
<br />
“No, sir…”
<br />
“You don’t believe that either, do you?”
<br />
Claudius did not, or rather could not reply.
<br />
“Anyhow, it is late.” Camillus muttered after a short pause, “Good night.”
<br />
“Yes sir.” He muttered with a salute before walking off.
<br />

<br />
“You’re a soldier, not a lady of the court!” Claudius shouted at the soldier he was duelling, “Fight like one!”
<br />
The soldier glared at him but said nothing.
<br />
“Charge at me, weakling!” the captain yelled to provoke the boy who in turn did as he was told but was repelled and thrown aside, “You don’t charge aggressively enough!” Claudius muttered as he turned around, sheathed his sword and walked away. He could hear the boy cursing as he got to his feet and picked up his sword but did not see what was to come. The boy charged again, “Is this aggressive enough for you captain!?” he shouted as he charged for Captain Aemillianus and cut him across the back from the tip of his right arm to the shoulder blade of his left. Claudius turned around with a murderous look in his eyes, “What do you think you’re doing, soldier?”
<br />
“Charging aggressively…” the boy snapped.
<br />
Claudius nodded, “Charging?” he demanded, “Charging?! You –”
<br />
The general stepped forth, snatched the sword from the captain and poised it at the soldier but Claudius reached out and grabbed Camillus’ wrist with a look of disapproval before letting go. “You’re too kind, captain” the general growled then struck the soldier hard across the face with the flat of the blade, “I would have killed him…” 
<br />
“Permission to leave sir…” Claudius muttered.
<br />
Camillus sighed and rolled his eyes, “Dear God, Claudius! Of course!” he exclaimed as followed the captain toward his quarters, “Send the boy home. He is not to set foot in this camp or any others in the empire!” he ordered as he left. 
<br />
“I can take care of myself, general” Claudius muttered.
<br />
The general laughed, “I don’t doubt your skill, Captain but when you are bleeding pools from your back – I don’t see how you are able to help yourself.”
<br />
“Sir, I’d rather do this myself.” Claudius pleaded as he painfully pushed open the door to let himself inside but Camillus shook his head and entered after him, “Why?” he whispered into his ear, “Because, you’re really a woman?”
<br />
The colour drained from the captain’s face for an instant, “Sir. I –”
<br />
“That, we will discuss later; but for now, your wound needs attention.”
<br />
Claudius sat down in her chair and slowly began to remove her torn and blood sodden jacket and undershirt with her back facing Camillus. The sword had conveniently cut through the cloth bidding her chest and there was no need to fumble with it. The captain, with her head bowed and fists clenched; brooded about what would become of her while the general carefully cleaned and dressed her wound.
<br />
“What do you propose I do with you woman?” Camillus sneered, “Send you away in shame? Or have you executed?”
<br />
She wrung her fingers in her hands but said nothing, there was nothing to say. After years of keeping her identity well hidden, she had been discovered and not by a mere soldier but by her commander.
<br />
The general chuckled, “I was only poking fun, Claudius. No harm shall befall you…” he told her reassuringly, “I’ve actually known for quite sometime and was simply seeking an opportunity to ask you…” he explained, “Why do you think I assigned you private quarters when there were empty bunks in the officer’s barracks?”
<br />
Claudius breathed a small sigh of relief but was cut short by Camillus’ questions.
<br />
“Why in the world did you enlist?” he asked, “Women your age ought to be home rearing children….”
<br />
She scoffed, “Is that what you think of us, sir?”
<br />
“No….well…I’ll be honest, yes” he said, “Until this day I have never seen a woman do anything but…” Camillus sighed, “What drove you to give up the joys of womanhood for this hellhole?”
<br />
“I have my reasons…”
<br />
He laughed, “I know your reasons. Augustus has told me that you work hard to feed your little peasant family: the widowed mother, sister, brother-in-law and your little niece” he stopped for a moment, “but you’re not really one of them are you?”
<br />
“I don’t understand…”
<br />
“You’re well educated, for one and …” he let his voice trail off. Claudius didn’t dare question him and let the comment go; dismissing it as product of the general’s curiosity. There was no way he could have remembered or let alone discovered her past.
<br />

<br />
Marcius was filled ecstasy as he stepped out of Claudius’ quarters and shut the door behind him. It was her…His childhood friend, his long lost bride to be. But he couldn’t tell her so; he couldn’t tell anyone.
<br />
 From the beginning there had been something vaguely familiar about his handsome new captain, almost too beautiful to be called handsome. When he had caught a glimpse of her bathing, suspicions had suddenly turned into a possible reality. Now he had seen the black dragon – crest of the Adelfius family tattooed on her left shoulder blade, his doubts were confirmed. And he wondered whether the porcelain doll of his childhood still remembered him.<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f205/ds_mikage/Shinimegamicopy.jpg" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by k4kashi on Wed Feb 22, 2006 8:35 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

<br />

<br />
Life carried on despite the dreary overcast sky shrouding the city in its bone chilling drizzle. Three men, each with their own bodyguards exited their respective vehicles, seemingly engaged in an intriguing conversation that lasted as they stepped into the elevator and back out again on the 31st floor. Silence befell them as they walked grimly down the long corridor to the meeting room. Each man was now consumed in his own thoughts; for each one of them, today was just like any other winter day. It had never occurred to any of them that something extraordinary would take place today, or that there was a sniper perched upon the roof of the adjacent building, waiting for them.
<br />
As swiftly as she had come, the sniper disappeared. Having fired three silent but fatal shots, she fled from the hiding spot and re-entered the building; merging effortlessly into the crowd of office crawling returning home after a days work in the concrete jungle. She glared at the emergency vehicles parked in front of the building as she climbed into the car and set down the briefcase in the passenger seat. Her presence had been but three penny sized holes in a skyscraper window –they would never find her…
<br />

<br />
‘Cuz every time we touch I feel the rhythm
<br />
            And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
<br />

<br />
“The weather outside is shit…” one of the customers muttered to the bartender who was busy mixing the strawberry daiquiri he had ordered.
<br />
The young bartender nodded and smiled, “Sadly, we’re not any busier than usual”, he said as he place the cocktail before the man. He glanced anxiously at the clock 6:15 – it wasn’t like her to be late…He sat down with a sigh and watched while the small crowd danced and swayed to the music.
<br />

<br />
                        I want you to know, I need you by my side…
<br />

<br />
He glanced around the nightclub once again. There she was, sitting on a bar stool several meters from him. She sat with her long legs crossed in a way that made them look a mile long, chin resting in the palm of her right hand while the fingers of the other drummed rhythmically on the counter. In her black gothic outfit, with the tail of her leather trench coat falling over the back of the bar stool – she looked like vampire or some obscure goddess of death. 
<br />
He stared at her but she did not return his gaze; she merely stood up then disappeared into the crowd. The bartender smiled to himself – everything was alright. He left then, having spotted the girl who would take over the next shift. He gathered his things and pulling his coat over his shoulders, headed out into the freezing rain.
<br />
There she was again, walking towards the where he stood before the back entrance of The Phoenix. They walked towards one another as if completely unaware of each other’s presence then seemingly ran accidentally into one another as they walked by. The bartender reached a hand into his coat pocket; there was a piece of paper that hadn’t been there before. He would read it once he was truly alone in his car.
<br />
Kai,
<br />
All is well. 
<br />
I am taking your next few missions for you while you recuperate. I’m sure Esmé won’t want you to push yourself too hard in your current state.
<br />
Rae
<br />

<br />
He nodded and smiled as he started the engine – he hated doing what he did and the longer he could put it off, the better. The fact that he had to kill and steal for a living tore him apart every time he set out on a mission. But all he knew was that if he was to go on living he would have to kill. He also wondered also about the others – like Renata and Taylor – who seemed to enjoy what they did. It paid well and they had whatever time left between missions to themselves: partying, clubbing, getting drunk or high and having sex; the nature of their relationship went far beyond a partnership, unlike that of himself and Rae. Contrary to the chirpy and humorous Renata, Rae was quiet, melancholy and never smiled. Keeping to herself most of the time with her running, music and video games when she was not at school, he rarely saw her. 
<br />
At least not until a month ago when he was badly injured in an explosion, whereon she went to see him everyday for two weeks to take care of feed, lean and clothe him, change his dressings and give him morphine to suppress the pain that surged through every limb in his body. He had broken his right forearm in three places, fractured two ribs, broken his tibia and had a strip of steel driven into his left shoulder blade from the sheer force of the blast. He was much better now but the reflection of his scarred body in the mirror still brought back painful memories of the incident –both mentally and physically. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Rae sat down in her usually seat in the music room, glad that the school day was over. She routinely took out her cello from its case, adjusted to the tail pin same height she always did and placed it into the second hole on the donut fixed under front left leg of her chair before removing her bow from its place. 
<br />
Taking a deep breath she began to play, beginning with scales and arpeggios before moving on to pieces. Half a bar into her solo part in the second movement of Rakastava, she stopped, unable to concentrate. Her attention was divided between the music and the boy who stood at the door with a sketchbook in his hand, clearly drawing a picture of her. She set her cello down abruptly and approached him. 
<br />
“May I see that?”
<br />
He nodded and handed it to her, she flipped through it quickly; it was filled with pictures of people, some he had seen before, playing sports, in a pose or just sitting there, the last few were quick but beautiful sketches of her – running on the track, stretching and the latest was an incomplete one of her playing the cello – she had become his new model. Grabbing the pages with drawings of her in her fist, she tore them out of the sketchbook and slowly ripped them to shreds before the boy then handed the book back him. Without another word, Rae returned to her seat and resumed playing as if nothing had happened.
<br />
Several violinists glanced curiously at the art student with a book clutched in is arms and torn paper at his feet as they pushed passed through the door. 
<br />
“What’s his problem?” one of them whispered.
<br />
“Who knows?” said another.
<br />
Practice started in another five minutes and long before then, the art student had disappeared; it bothered her to have someone sneaking around, drawing pictures of her; especially when he had not even bothered to ask for consent. 
<br />
Orchestra passed by rather quickly the two hour long practice felt like a half an hour. And she was more than relieved when she was finally able to go home where there weren’t freaks that hid around the corner to draw –
<br />
Suddenly, her cell phone rang abruptly snapping her out of her train of thought
<br />
“Hello?”
<br />
“It’s Esmé”
<br />
“How was the mission last night?”
<br />
“Fine,” she replied.
<br />
“I will have another one for you soon” Esmé told her, “How long are you planning to do Kai’s tasks for him?”
<br />
Rae paused, “As long as it takes him to recover.”
<br />
“Recover?” Esmé sneered, “I’ve seen what sort of shape he’s in. He is of no further use to me or anyone, as a matter of fact. I want you to terminate him.”
<br />
“M’am –”
<br />
“I’m giving you two weeks to accomplish this task, I’m sure it will be more than enough time…” Esmé sneered then hung up.
<br />
She sighed and snapped her cellphone shut with a loud click; completely awestruck. Kai was Esmé’s pet; she loved, adored him. Why? How? Could she give the order to have him killed? Rae unlocked her car and sat down gloomily inside – putting her head down on the steering wheel – she didn’t have much of a choice…  
<br />
*
<br />
 Two weeks had come and gone in the blink of eye; but while those fourteen days lasted – it felt long, tedious. Today was the deadline and Rae had yet to lift a finger to even prepare to kill him. She stared at the digital clock on her night table as she sat numbly in her chair, it read 21:04. What was she to do?
<br />
The ringing of her cellphone startled her and she reached up to pick up.
<br />
“Hello?”
<br />
“Rae – you haven’t delivered me the body yet…”
<br />
“I’m sorry M’am; I was getting ready to leave –”
<br />
Esmé laughed, “Don’t give me excuses, Rae, just get it done…”
<br />
“Yes, M’am”
<br />
Rae snapped her cellphone shut and threw it against the wall in frustration. 
<br />
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Renata muttered.
<br />
“Nothing” Rae snapped angrily as she stood up and slowly reached for her coat with a loud sigh then grabbed her gun and keys from the kitchen counter; it was time to pay her partner a little visit.
<br />

<br />
She sat in the apartment in darkness, waiting until he would return. Rae glanced at her watch, 10:15; he would be home soon. His shift at The Phoenix ended at ten on Friday nights, or at least it was the last time she’d checked. Without fail, he was home within five minutes. Dropping his keys down on the dining table he turned on the light and was surprised to see Rae seated there with her arms crossed in front of her chest. 
<br />
“Rae? What are you doing here?” he asked with a frown.
<br />
She stood up, drew her gun and approached him quickly. With the muzzle but a few inches from his face; she cocked the weapon but did not fire.
<br />
“What are you waiting for?” he demanded, putting his hands up in surrender, “Go ahead and kill me…” 
<br />
The look in his beautiful blue-green eyes was not one of horror or disgust but of sorrow and sadness. And the .9mm trembled in her hand – she could not find the strength to pull the trigger, “You’re letting me kill you?” Rae said calmly, masking her frustration at the fact that she was not able to shoot him. He wasn’t like the others she’d killed. They were strangers, but he… he was a partner, a friend in a life she couldn’t remember… 
<br />
Kai shrugged, “One of us has to die” he replied, “I’d rather it be me than you…” he said adamantly. 
<br />
Rae lowered her weapon, struck him hard across the cheek with the side of her gun, and then fled the apartment. Leaving Kai to stand alone in awe at what had just taken place. 
<br />
She’d failed. 
<br />
What would Esmé say? 
<br />
Would she have her killed? 
<br />
What was the consequence?
<br />

<br />
When Rae returned, Renata was already asleep, no, not asleep. In bed with Taylor which meant she had to the sleep on the couch, again. She had contemplated for a long time whether she ought to clean out her work room and move her bed and the rest of her belongings in there. Rena and Taylor’s late night entertainment was making her lose sleep. It wasn’t just that she couldn’t sleep in her room; it was the fact that they were so damn loud. She slipped a disk into her Playstation then flopped down on the couch with her wireless controller to pass the time – and even perhaps bore herself to sleep – she’d played Silent Hill 4 a million times before… 
<br />
Midnight came and not a minute after, the phone call came. Not on her cellphone – but her home phone. Rae didn’t bother to pick up and sat by the phone while it rang and rang until the answering machine picked up the call.
<br />

<br />
“The deadline has passed Rae and you have yet to deliver me what I want…This is the first time you’ve deliberately dodge a task until the point of failure. But upon reflection, I do realize just how hard it is to accomplish. You will have another week to bring me what I have asked.”
<br />

<br />
Rae buried her face in her hands in frustration. “What am I doing to do?” she looked up and stared at the framed picture of her and Kai as kids playing on the teeter totter sitting hanging on the wall facing her.
<br />
 She remembered nothing of that day, before it or after it leading up to a few months before her fifteenth birthday. There was nothing there – just blank space where memories should have been. She could still remember waking up in a hospital bed in great pain with tubes protruding from her nose and mouth without any knowledge of who she was or what she was doing there. 
<br />
She simply…was… 
<br />

<br />
“What would you do, Rae?” she muttered, “What would you do?”
<br />

<br />
Renata stormed out of her room a few minutes later, “What the fuck were you doing? You scared the shit out of us!” She exclaimed.
<br />
“Sorry…”Rae muttered, her eyes apparently glued to the television screen.
<br />
Renata shook her heads, “You and your video games…when will you ever learn to grow up girl? You’re not in grade four! ” she chuckled before returning to the room and slamming the door behind her. 
<br />
Great…lets listen to them have sex…again…Rae thought bitterly as she threw her controller aside then grabbed the keys and headed out into the lamp lit streets. She had no where to turn – Esmé was hounding her for a victim she couldn’t bring herself to kill – everywhere she went, Esmé would know; Renata was too busy with her boyfriend to care for anything…
<br />
Rae bought herself a cup of coffee at the café a block from her condominium and sat down with the burning paper cup in her hands, wondering how long it would last her before she was kicked out: as it turned out – two hours, until closing time. She left the coffee untouched along with a large tip before heading out again into the night…
<br />

<br />
Two days later, Rae was perched upon the roof of the building opposite the condominium where Kai lived. In the darkness of night, she was invisible. Pressing her cheek against the cold steel, she peered into the scope for the fourth time and adjusted her aim. He was sitting in his bedroom – working at his desk with a bottle of beer beside him. With her finger on the trigger, she prepared to fire. But found that she couldn’t kill him. 
<br />
She sighed. What can’t I just pull the trigger? He’s not staring me in the face! What was there to feel guilty about? What’s wrong with me? She though angrily as she took apart her rifle and put it away before heading back home. Though she had another five days to accomplish the task, she decided that she wasn’t about to try to kill him again. 
<br />

<br />
“Back so soon?” Renata sneered when she heard the door open.
<br />
Rae entered and slammed the door behind her without a word. She was obviously very, very angry. “Where’s the body?”
<br />
“There is no body now” she muttered, “But there will one be in five days – mine.”
<br />
Her friend sighed heavily, “You couldn’t kill him…” she muttered.
<br />
“No shit” Rae muttered under her breath as she flopped down on the couch and buried her hands in her face, “God! What the fuck is wrong with me?” she said, wringing her fingers until they turned white. “The first time I went in person and I thought I could do it for sure but there was that look in his eyes that I can’t describe…so sad –“
<br />
“So gently yet so lonely?” Renata interjected, “What is it now – you took the sniper rifle with you – what’s the problem this time round?”
<br />
Rae shook her head, “That’s what’s tearing me apart – I have no idea why” she growled, “I can’t do it. Doesn’t Esmé see that? Doesn’t she know that? She knows just about every other fucking little detail of our goddamned lives!” she exhaled deeply and composed her thoughts, “God, I sound like a fucking soap opera…”
<br />
Her roommate put a hand on her shoulder, “If you can’t kill him, then he was meant to live” she whispered.
<br />
“How?” she muttered, turning to her friend with a look of anguish on her face.
<br />
Renata smiled, “You’re superman – not me. You figure out how” she told her, “You always manage to pull through in the end, no matter what. And I believe you already know the answer…”
<br />

<br />
Kai opened the door with a look of surprise on his face, “Back again, are we?” he sneered. But Rae said nothing. Stepping inside, she pushed the door shut and reached into her coat pocket.
<br />
“Why didn’t you kill me last time?” Kai asked, “I know you’re after me now, did you expect to catch me off guard again?”
<br />
She pushed him into the dining room and shoved him into a chair, “I didn’t come here to kill you…” she said, “not this time…”
<br />
“Then what did you come to do?” he watched in silence as Rae opened a plastic case containing two small 5ml syringes filled with different coloured suspensions. “What is that?” he demanded, but Rae did not reply, taking the one of them she removed the cap but Kai drew back, “You’re going to get killed for this” he exclaimed, “You of all people should know that I’d rather die than live at the expense of other people’s lives!”
<br />
Rae scoffed, “Well, Kai…I’m not giving you a choice” she said adamantly as she grabbed his arm and jabbed the needle into one of the visible veins in his forearm. He winced in pain but said nothing more when the contents of the second needle were forced into his body. “That wasn’t so bad…was it?”
<br />
“Rae! Esmé is going to have you shot for this!”
<br />
She shrugged as she placed the syringes into the box and slipped the case back into her pocket, and with that she left – slamming the door behind her with a loud thud. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Rae stepped out of the shower to the smell of toast, egg s and bacon – Renata was awake. “How was your run?” her roommate asked as she stepped into the kitchen.
<br />
She shrugged and poured herself a glass of water, “Same old…”
<br />
“I went to see Kai yesterday when you were at that race…”
<br />
Rae chuckled, “Are you two timing Taylor now? One guy not enough for you?”
<br />
Renata rolled her eyes and threw a towel at Rae.
<br />
“Okay…I was kidding!” she exclaimed, putting her hands up in mock surrender. 
<br />
“You’re not going to ask how he’s doing?”
<br />
Rae raised an eyebrow, “should I be?”
<br />
“Well, duh!” Renata muttered, “He is your partner after all…”
<br />
“Whatever” she said with a shrug, “We can’t all be kind and caring like you…”
<br />
Her roommate shook her head, “God! You’re hopeless…”
<br />
“Uh huh…”
<br />
                                                            *
<br />
 “Go! Go! Go!” Rae whispered.
<br />
“Are you fucking insane?” Kai snapped.
<br />
She shook her head, “I’ll cover for you…”
<br />
He rolled his eyes as he crept into the corridor full of guards having accomplished the mission – all that was left was to escape. Which turned out to be harder than anyone could ever imagine. “Fuck!” Rae muttered, hearing the sound of distant shots.
<br />
“Great…”
<br />
Rae sighed, “Go!”
<br />
“In there?”
<br />
“No! Out the exit you idiot!” she snapped as she pushed him out the storm of the machine gunfire and charged into it, “Leave the premises immediately!”
<br />
Kai sighed, “Fucking crazy bitch thinks she’s fucking invincible…” he muttered under his breath as he bolted for the exit. Half way there, he stopped, contemplating whether he should go back for her…but what did it matter? 
<br />
He went on and didn’t turn back.
<br />

<br />
Kai was troubled at the fact that Rae was not in school the following day when he looked around the biology classroom to find her seat empty. But he had no idea that this was to go on for several days.
<br />
“Rachel! Rachel Lindenmaier!” the teacher paused, “Absent again?”
<br />
Several classmates mutter amongst themselves.
<br />
“Can anyone get in touch with her and ask her what’s going on?”
<br />
“I told you yesterday and the day before, sir, she was into a motorcycle accident!” one of her friends muttered. That was a lie – Rae didn’t ride motorbikes- she hated them. But evidently, she couldn’t tell her friends she’d been shot or had the shit beaten out of her by a bunch of guards in the building she had broken in and stolen from.  
<br />
“Alright then…”
<br />
Kai sat with his cheek propped up against his knuckles in a thoughtful pose as he sat in the nearly empty classroom – wondering what had happened to Rae. He would have to go see her after school today – it’d been almost a week since the last mission and he had yet to hear from her. Something was definitely wrong.
<br />
He dialled her number as he approached the door of her apartment, suddenly remembering that she was bothered by people barging in. The phone rang and rang until finally, he heard the receiver being picked up.
<br />
“Hello? Rae?”
<br />
“Yeah. It’s me…” her voice sounded hoarse and groggy as if she had too many drinks, “To whom am I speaking?”
<br />
“It’s me Kai.”
<br />
She cleared her throat, “Can I help you?”
<br />
“Just checking if you were alright.”
<br />
“I’m fine, thank you.”
<br />
“Good. I’m standing outside your door as we speak. I’m coming in.”
<br />
“No…no. Everything’s fine”
<br />
He hung up abruptly and tried the door knob; the door was unlocked – how very unlike her. Stepping inside he shut the door quietly behind him. “Rae?” he muttered as he walked towards her bedroom.
<br />
“I said I was fine”, came a voice from within. She sounded even worse in person.
<br />
Kai paused at the doorway and peered into the room cautiously. The floor around her bed was littered with bloodstained bandages and old dressings. Rae lay in bed looking pale and wraithlike as if she hadn’t any food or sleep in years.
<br />
“You call this ‘fine’?” he snapped angrily as he bent over and began picking up the bloody dressings from the floor, “You’ll die like this.”
<br />
She shrugged, “Who cares. I’ve seen better days.” Even in her condition she was her old pessimistic self, Kai thought bitterly as he quickly exited her room to throw out the garbage and wash his hands. He ran to the kitchen and poured her a glass of water – as there was nothing else to drink, not a drop of milk or juice.
<br />
Kai rushed back into her room, “Why didn’t you call?” he demanded angrily as he set the glass on the night table and proceeded to help her sit up.
<br />
Rae took a sip and almost chocked, “Thanks” she muttered hoarsely but didn’t answer his question.
<br />
“I asked you a question…”
<br />
She shrugged, “It’s nothing serious.”
<br />
“Nothing serious?!” he growled, “Are you kidding me? Would you be lying in bed like this, half dead, if it was nothing serious?!”
<br />
“Alright, stop yelling!” she exclaimed.
<br />
Kai sighed, “I’m sorry. I was just worried about you…” he muttered.
<br />
“Thank you for your concern” she muttered monotonously as if it was obligatory.
<br />
He leaned forward and planted a kiss on her forehead, “Wait here. I’ll fix you something to eat, and then I’ll change your dressings.”
<br />
“I can –”
<br />
“Don’t argue. You’re the wounded one now.”
<br />

<br />
Kai returned a half hour later, “Dinner won’t be ready for another twenty minutes. Let’s get you cleaned up first. Uh…” he paused, wondering how he should go about getting her ‘cleaned up’. “Um…can you stand?”
<br />
“Yea…pretty much” she replied, “I can take care of myself. Don’t worry.”
<br />
He nodded, “Okay then. Why don’t you go take a shower?”
<br />
She nodded and sat up slowly, then got out of the bed in the same fashion – still quite shaky on her feet. He turned back to the mess on her bed – the sheets and covers were smeared with blood – dark and rusty. They would need to be changed. Kai found a new set in the linen closest then stripped down the old covers and tossed them aside. Who knew that someone could bleed so much? And how could Esmé possibly leave her in such a state?
<br />
Rae turned on the hot water and let it run over her body – the water swirling around her feet was pink with her own blood as she scrubbed vigorously at the dried blood crusted on her skin. Every part of her body hurt, every limb, every muscle, even her scalp hurt from falling into the bed of broken glass upon her grand exit – a suicidal jump out a fifth floor. But she was still quite lucky; having suffered only two shots – one to the left shoulder and the other to her arm. When she finally got out of the shower, Kai was already gone – he’d left a note on her night table. 
<br />
It’s almost 6 – Esmé will be home soon. I think its best if I leave before then. Pasta and sauce is on the stove, there are lamb chops in the oven – enjoy yourself and I hope you like it! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> See you later! (but with Esmé around 24/7I don’t think I will be able to for the next little while…). Take care of yourself!
<br />
                                                     Love, Kai.
<br />
Rae crumpled the note in her hand, threw it into the toilet and flushed it. Stuff like this shouldn’t be left lying around otherwise, dire consequences will follow. And Rae was sure that neither she nor Kai were ready to face them, whatever they may be. Just then  
<br />

<br />
Rae sipped her drink to fill up the empty silence and searched her brain for something to talk about but –
<br />
“Hey cutie!” a high pitched voice giggled from behind them.
<br />
She turned around to see a woman who approached Kai and proceeded to sit down beside him, acting in a rather provocative manner. “What’s your name?” she asked. Kai turned the other way and ignored her, eyes fixed upon Rae. After a few attempts to make conversation, the woman left apparently very angry.
<br />
“Kai, you’re such a prude” Rae exclaimed when she was sure that the lady was out of earshot, “She was only flirting.”
<br />
He laughed, “Look who’s talking…”
<br />
“I’m not a prude!” she protested.
<br />
“Yes you are!”
<br />
“No I’m not!”
<br />
“Then kiss me!” Kai told her.
<br />
Rae laughed, “No.”
<br />
“Well, I proved my point…” he said with a smirk.
<br />
“Fine. I’ll prove it!” 
<br />
She leaned in, closing the space between them, several centimetres from his face, Rae burst out laughing, “I can’t do it.”
<br />
“Prude…” he muttered then sipped his drink; eyes still fixed intently upon her as he did so. She held his gaze for a few moments before a spot of colour appeared on her cheeks and she turned away, clearly embarrassed. Kai set down his shot glass and reached across the counter to put his hand over hers the squeezed it gently. Rae looked up, smiled but said nothing more. He inched his face closer and closer to her until their lips brushed and he kissed her. This time, she did not protest. To his surprise, she opened her mouth and kissed him back, slow and gentle.
<br />
Rae turned her gaze toward the display of glasses across from her when the kiss ended, red and embarrassed once again. She inhaled deeply and let out at soft chuckle, “Yeah, you’re right. I am a prude.” She muttered, “I’m all red and it was only a kiss…”
<br />
“It doesn’t have to be “only a kiss”…” he told her.
<br />
She stared at him blankly for a while then turned back to her drink, not knowing what she ought to say. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
“Let’s review the density of an Ideal Gas at STP…”
<br />
Rae sighed softly for the sixth time in the past five minutes– trying her hardest to stay awake. Density equalled molar mass over molar volume – the same as it was yesterday. Neither chemistry nor anything, as a matter of fact, was of any interest to her at the moment. Her eyelids felt heavy from the heavy dose of morphine she’d given herself before school to suppress the pain of her wounds. And now that it was slowly wearing off – the dull, throbbing sensation was slowly returning to her body – it was the only thing keeping her awake. Suddenly her phone vibrated in her pocket, making her jump. As soon as the teacher turned back the board – she slipped it out of its hiding place.
<br />
NEW TEXT MESSAGE

  Rae smiled to herself as she quickly typed her reply:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
He was waiting outside her chemistry class when she finally dragged herself out of her desk. Taking the books from her, he escorted her outside, “You should have stayed home…” he told her, “You look like one of those crackheads smoking their heads off outside like there’s no tomorrow….”
<br />
Rae laughed, “Just 10 cc’s of morphine – its not so bad” she protested, “anyways, it’s wearing off and I’m already less sleepy…let’s go to bio”. Kai shook his head, “You can’t go to class like this…” he told her, “come on – let’s get out of here.” 
<br />
“Playing hooky again?”
<br />
He shrugged, “who cares…I only came to school to see you anyways…”<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f205/ds_mikage/Shinimegamicopy.jpg" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
