				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Going to do a round summary from my point of view.
<br />

<br />
The main councils at the start of the round were Koreans (Untitled), AGOD, Imperial Scourge, Ascension and GA...others too but they didnt really play a part in the round.
<br />

<br />
At the start Imperial Scourge took top, this was just temporary though because there was no chance of them holding their place, AGOD swiftly took them down and replaced them in most of top 10 positions.
<br />

<br />
Koreans were also in contention but the 2 councils didnt come to blows until Cypherus blockaded a Korean, he beat the Korean quite easily but we didnt have enough council members on at the time to declare war so there was never a war to follow up. AGOD went to bed and Koreans used that time to make fleets with nice tech and declare war on AGOD and AGOD were left mostly dead, only Redjack was left in-tact since the koreans were unsure to hit him because they had been told he was in Ascension, which were allied to Koreans from start.
<br />

<br />
Once my fleet had been broken (took 4 Koreans to do it) I declared independance to avoid the mass rape, I was followed by Rapir but I was online so he couldnt kill me. I hit him back and dropped him out of my range and bided by time till I got the tech for IFG. Once I got IFG I went to work and went solo against all of ASC - 8 hours later they were all out of my range and I turned my attention to Kr. IFG didnt work as well on the Koreans as it did on ASC so I convinced Redjack to help me hit them, we broke all the Koreans in range but could only rape them out of range, which didnt really hurt them much in the long run. We accepted that we couldnt kill them with 2 players so we agreed to a NAP with them. 
<br />

<br />
AGOD had pretty much disbanded at that point, Cypherus had went to Imperial Scourge after dieing, the others who died didnt restart or make a new character right away so myself and Redjack were completely alone. Later on some AGOD restarted and eventually worked their way up to being the #2 council behind Koreans, at that point the Koreans must have decided they were a threat and planned to take them down. Azrael and Seiffer agreed that AGOD would join ASC - this was azy's plan to get AGOD included in thet NAP Ascension had with Koreans but it didnt work, Koreans were either never told that AGOD had joined or simply didnt care. Koreans hit them back into the stoneage but they seemed to recover reasonably well.
<br />

<br />
I'm still not sure to this day if Koreans actually gave Redjack a NAP, that is what they were asked for and at the time perhaps they did since we were a big threat to them, either way the Koreans eventually hit Redjack - they said it was because he hit them earlier in round when he wasnt supposed to (he was napped to them through Ascension). Redjack died, I was completely alone  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
After awhile Imps+GA formed a NAP to takedown Koreans but they couldnt really make much progress at first because ASC were basically doing Koreans dirty work and keeping Imps+GA weak, I personally didnt see this as fair and wanted to see more competitiveness so I broke the fleets of any Ascension in my range and hoped others would kill them. It didnt work out that way at first, I broke Ascension but they kept coming back with help from Koreans. The 3rd time I broke their fleets IMPS and I think GA also managed to keep them down for good, and they werent a problem for the rest of the set..allowing Imps+GA to have their shot at taking down Koreans.
<br />

<br />
Imps+GA were doing a fine job, Koreans were falling quite fast thanks to Naru in particular who was stationing and allowing himself to be killed until he had a fleet that he could fight Koreans with. This turned out to be a good strategy since his ship building was all in his commerce anyway.
<br />

<br />
I wasnt particularly hoping 1 side would win, I just wanted an interesting set.
<br />

<br />
Koreans eventually fell and since Imps were doing most of the work they came out of the war as #5 council behind AGOD (now Darkness Falls), GA, The Spawn and NA. Not exactly what they deserved but the war with Koreans hurt them quite a bit and even though GA were supposed to be helping them kill Koreans, they didnt really put much effort in.
<br />

<br />
From that point on the round stagnated and besides a few minor conflicts everyone just waited for the end of the set.
<br />

<br />
Darkness Falls killed the majority of empire planets, fortress layers and Naru took a very tough Capital Planet.<br />_________________<br />Kenshin, Naraku, Grey Fox, iO, Aquinas, Onyx, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Metro, Nightshade, Fear, .

Game start Phase:

<br />
We had a rather pre-thought game plan for the set-start, secure clusters, take lead in technology, and own everyone else. ShadowmanZERO (SMZ) was Rogue (#12), human, and did fairly well and secured his cluster from the grasp of NC and co., I myself was Naru of Archspace (#400) and fooled around as usual, breaking protection at the first available chance and picking free planets from other protect-breakers  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> I think player i (#301) has the honor of being the first killed in the set, and I soon took first place, but fell to Azrael, LOUDER (#???), overnight. It seemed that before I slept I encountered a full Lying Dormant (LD) armada protecting a LUR, and got greedy, so I killed it and when I slept he got his revenge, nice job Azy! SMZ fell not too much later when it got to the cruiser phase, as he got seriously outnumbered by the number of veterans from NC (NC = AGOD = Cypherus/RJ/Ken/SG and co.) and Korean (KR) councils.
<br />

<br />
So after our last bastion of power fell early game, I abandoned my Agerus and headed for technology power using the nick Cypherus (#710) to confuse people!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> SMZ attempted to regain control, and KRs and others started to swarm Tedjung, eldrak, GIJoe (GI), darkfyre (DF), nefus, Exx and such. In particular, Koreans were picking on DF alot, and she got hell of a time fighting them off. During this chaotic phase Ascension (ASC) formed a Non-Agression Pact (NAP) with the KRs with NC taking top place side-by-side with them. We knew if KRs and NC didn't hit each other IMPS and others would virtually have no chance. I myself reteched rather quickly thanks to some decent commerce provided from my starting council and went side-by-side leeching Cyph's Y' Draig Goch (#???) commerce.
<br />

<br />
Indeed, IMPS did adopt a highly aggressive stance toward non-leading councils and attempted to forge a minor domination standard below the higher ranking players. As fate would have it, I hit some council (think was UA or Assembly), and then Wraith (#???), fled and a while later, they got 3 councils to declare on the current main IMPS council, I think it was the scariest moment in time for the enemy as they vastly outnumbered us (each of us had like 20 on the siege list), but one by one they were defleeted and taken down by HBH BC I had stashed somewhere. That gave IMPS some morale to rebuild and rearm. Cyph got sick of his Targoid after he got owned due to inferior Targoid commanders, and decided to restart as Agerus. At this point in time, I had lost my commerce partner, therefore jumped to GI's council, and helped him build up a nice core, which eventually became the production that would wreck the Korean war effort.
<br />

<br />
Redjack (RJ) fell soon after, much to our surprise, to a Korean strike, which saw the current NC power ring shattered and left them vulnerable to attack. Concurrently, ASC decided to launch a war on IMPS to prevent us from successfully eliminating NC from the picture, and as Kenshin said, I never lost a fleet to them even though I died like 2-3 times, even though it cost me some technology, my ships were already designed, and upon 2 hours of respawning, I could resurrect my production with commerce and such. After a few strikes on IMPS, ASC layed off, but that was when the tides turned. Kenshin blocked some ASC players and the rest were swiftly defleeted and raped before by a combined effort from IMPS and Guerilla Alliance (GA). IMPS had hoped not to sign a NAP with anyone, but this war would be impossible with a third front to fight, and lack of players to rape the lower levels.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, IMPS decided to work together with GA (although a formal NAP/alliance was never laid down, as this was a cooperation based on mutual interests), and fortified a position outside the KR doorstep. Blood (#253) from the KR council decided to hunt for a core and jumped from KR main to pick on various IMPS and GA players, and I accepted the players that were running for him, so he decided to declare on me as well, but unfortunately for him, immediately after declaration cooldown was over, I defleeted him and all his URs were raped. I believe he was eventually killed overnight.
<br />

<br />
The next morning, Blood got Rapir (#308) to join in the battle for URs. Already battle wear, and having already given up my URs to the other IMPS players, I decided to station and let him take whatever he liked. Priest-On (#250?? or #253??) and Horiz-On (#250 or #253) decided to declare war and killed me, but they got killed before I even logged on again by GA. At this point, NC was beaten and KRs had a very strong lead. It was not long after before Xenoage, the ruin of ... (#191) decided to go on a planet hunt with H-O-H (#194) along with the ever-so-annoying Tachyon Teca (TT) (#662). Tacyhon stayed small and in protection, so it was difficult for anyone to kill him and he had council speakership, so after killing one/two KR players, he could bring in backup reliably, which caused IMPS quite a problem. They beat down most of our players, and raped me a little, but as usual, I was stationed while AFK. Exx, Oceanus (#444) and nefus, Subtract me (#448) planned to build suicidal cloaked dreads to soften the KR armadas, and eldrak, Div by 0 (#538) also managed to build up quite a force. GI, my commerce partner, was flourishing, until KRs massed declared and raped him dead (he was also stationed, but unfortunately, he was UR-dependent, so he decided to respawn, suicide an armada, and create a new character). Cypherus' Agerus, Carnage (#1218) was also building up quite nicely, though his constant Stellar Bombardments incited some KRs to war us  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Then when it was time, all of IMPS jumped into one collective council and undertook a massive operation - strike KR main council and rape their lower players dead. The attack was hugely successful, as the Koreans were not expecting a bold attack like this to hit their main power council, and it caught most of them off-guard. A few pre-war blocks from IMPS saw the instant-raping of lower KR members and deaths of some others, IMPS stacked their spoils on SMZ, who promptly retired with 100s of planets to prevent them from falling into KR hands again, and then created Ruined Galaxy (#1365), a Xerusian focusing on Player vs Player (PVP) combat.
<br />

<br />
Later that day, the KRs counter-attacked, but they found that they could not retrieve most of the URs they had lost, though TT managed to rape me to death. Somehow, I resurrected my character and rebuilt a little, but Xenoage was filled with vengeance, and decided to declare on IMPS to keep us down. He had just declared independence and declared war on a hugeeee number of councils, and I saw that as an opportune time to reveal my armada, and like Blood, he was defleeted seconds after war declaration cooldown ended, and was raped a little, before we forced a truce to prevent him from calling in backup to counterattack. The defeat of Xenoage bought much needed time for those he'd been beating on, namely eldrak, nefus and Exx to establish a nice secure position. A few more KRs jumped in, and hawk (#945) fluffed around and crashed his armadas a few on people  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> In any case, KR morale was down due to the loss of their star player. nefus made a few successful hits on Xenoage a while later and that saw his assistance to the KR war effort end.
<br />

<br />
Maddy had silently restarted as Xerusian and terrorizing the lower ranks with his ownage NRL, but was ended when he stubbornly declared hostile intents and begun blocking my planets one-by-one (they weren't producing anything, but they sure gave me commerce!), his scary NRL armada consisted for 20 fleets of his own, with 8 allied doomstar fleets. Playing tactically, I suicided dreadnaughts on random commanders aimed at his allied, and took out a fleet, then I suicided 20 mobile fortress fleets to soften his forward position, before sending in 20 doomstar fleets against 26, the losses were great but his NRL was ineffective against what I had hidden on my homeworld - shield doomstar walls. The fall of the KR leader hurt their morale even more, IMPS now had a clear advantage in terms of skilled fleets and ship designs as well as production.
<br />

<br />
GA helped on occassion by raping the defleeted players, and this proved effective in eliminating a defleeted player from combat semi-permanently. I recall making a shitload of commerce off a built up Cyph and Bio (#1005) who became prominent defenders of the council and most URs achieved were redistributed so everyone could have a piece. It wasn't long before the Koreans were outproduced and mobbed to death, except Rapir, who had fluffed to like, 30million power?
<br />

<br />
After building up a pseudo-armada, I took up the challenge of fluffing into Rapir's range, but after a scout I realised he had 20 full fleets which my damaged armada couldn't take down at that time, and since I had RJ, I decided to sit out of his range by 100k power and mass some DS, but before RJ could enter Rapir's range, Smartguy (SG) and Apocalyptic (Apoc), - (#814) and Bhaal (#708) respectively, declared and without a full armada ready, I defluffed, but Cyph made off with a bold hit on Apoc, which saw his best commies killed off, before defluffing as well.
<br />

<br />
SG, Apoc merged into the rest of NC soon after and Rapir decided to come down and do some beating. His Clonable Double fleet, which I hoped to train some commanders on, defeated my l13s in battle, and I defluffed yet again. The next day, he killed eldrak and took his home planet, Div by 0, and that was the last straw. I pulled out my serious armada and with some additional milking from SMZ, Rapir fell, twice, to my armada. Cypherus managed to defleet him once as well, and an estimated 2.5k dooms were killed by me, and 800 by Cyph, and soon he defluffed and stuck cloaked cruisers out on Clonable Doubles, which proved highly irritating for non-detection races. Fortunately, Psychic Progenitors have Full Cloak Detection (FCD) at level 1, and Undos, Egghead (#19), had quite a few spare Mental Giants (MGs), which proved to be invaluable in killing his cloaked cruisers, but he was hiding a last spare armada, which he used to defleet some of GA and rape them. Ultimately, he got overconfident and attempted to break Bio, who promptly fended off his fleets with relatively few losses, and that saw his retirement, but not before &gt; 100 planets were retrieved from him by IMPS and GA combined.
<br />

<br />
NC had then built up and recovered from their middle-set defeat, and no one felt like fighting anymore since it was one of the rare sets that domination got ended. Rapir extended the set by returning ~120 Empire planets. Soon the tedious work of building up for Empire capital begun, but no one knew that Cypherus had a nigh-impossible set-up on the capital planet. Zoo, Gaja (#708) accelerated the fall of the Empire planets and the Fortress layers fell easily too, with IMPS working their way first on the inner sanctum. Cyph captured the first two layers within a few minutes, and DF captured the third, I captured the 4th, and crashed my PVP armada on the Capital planet. Reeling from the loss, I used my remaining PVP armada to take the other fortress layer. A while later, I reattempted capital with that PVP armada, got rather close, but failed nonetheless.
<br />

<br />
After that, GA and Darkness Falls (DFalls) made their way to the capital planet and one-by-one everyone crashed an armada and...

The road to the Imperial Capital of Caput Mundi lays open to your fleets. The unequalled fame and power are within grasp upon victory, and you may even found your own empire.
<br />

<br />
But you will be faced with the best of the best. The Imperial Guard Fleets, strongest Elite Forces and powerful defense forts will resist to the last man, and it won't be an easy fight. The resistance wouldn't be like anything you've seen before.

Will you launch the military campaign upon the Imperial Capital?

Many took up the gauntlet soon after and attempted to lay waste to Jo 'Keric's 1200 doomstar guard fleets, a few got them down to ~300, but on average the surviving doomstar count was ~600. Cyph was contemplating nerfing the Empire but I told him to hold it off and give me a day as I was confident the losses were due to design flaws (I had Eternium, which kept had critical hits on it for 600-800k damage!), and he kindly granted me a day. It took a while to gather the right commanders and ships before Jo 'Keric's reign of terror finally came to a halt. Congrats to all the players of AS!

And thank you SMZ for letting me play in IMPS this set ^^

Good luck to all for the next upcoming set, it will be chaotic, but I shall not divulge too much  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
Ascension had a very interesting set ourself.
<br />

<br />
Before the set started, as is standard custom, we were watching ranks and player names when I happened upon DarkPanzers (#93) Fearing that this was the real player, I immediatly diplomatic messaged him. At this point he responded that he was the real player and he did remember me and he invited me to his channel on irc, and I invited him to mind. Within half an hour of that point an official alliance with Ascension and Koreans that would define our rise, and fall, this set was formed. At this set start I, Transylvania Knight (#1) ended up having to work for much too much time, but, my second in command, DrJekyl, TaZMaNiaN DeViL (#3) had quite the opposite situation. He was able to be active and through a very important pair of boons (mk4 ships and 4m pp) for the first day, nobody else was able to touch black market. This proved invaluable to our start. Having allied the koreans, we knew we were in no imminent danger, and when I returned home from work I went on the offensive. Although IMPS had secured their clustere, both jekyl and I were in non IMPS clusters and quickly we secured ours. After securing our prominent clusters, Ascension went into a lull to tech up and build up in peace due to a request from maddy (player name Xenoage), this would be one of the gravest mistakes we made all set.
<br />

<br />
We continued our buildup in order to defend our allies, than out of surprise to both councils, NC went on the offensive, severely hindering all of koreans. But, not to be out-done, koreans gained the upper hand and it was requested that I personally hit Kenshin, . (#165), I obliged, but unfortunately due to council range, I was unable to declare war and finish him, which was the last factor in my personal downfall. Not long after I hit, Kenshin got insanity field generator, which due to my slow start and his fast start, was capable of completely decimating me. Seeing this strategy, I did the only thing I could, I warned the koreans. Xenoage himself had just gotten insanity field generator, which aided the cause immensely. Kenshin was able to establish himself and take over the top (This is the third / fourth up top...IMPS, NC, KR/ASC, NC). After which Kenshin comes in and in order to secure a NAP with the koreans, he also NAPs ascension. At this point, I retired because of how bad I had fucked my start (little did I know, the first of many) and I restarted as Casablanka (#835). I obtained Insanity Field Generator rapid pace and was able to defeat METATRON (#10) with ease, along with a couple other GA councils. After this point, an 'anonymous' tip from kenshin to GA ended up in my being defleeted and killed. The NAP with kenshin was officially off.
<br />

<br />
Every high powered ASC was therefore defleeted by kenshin with ease and GA moved in to pick up the scraps. They were largely unsuccessful however and we managed to push them back repeatedly while Koreans faced against IMPS. I rebuilt fairly fast and managed to get back up to speed, at which point Azrael messages me on IRC and proposes a combination of ASC and NC, which went into effect. Due to this burst of life, Ascension looked to be coming to life and we turned our sights to Imperial Scourge. Cypherus and Naru (Y Ddriag Goch and Cypherus) were our main targets in the offensive due to their overwhelming power. naru fell easily as he had no fleets on defense, a recurrent trait of his. Cypherus was another story...When Apocalyptic went to drop his power to hit cypherus (apoc = bhaal) cypherus declared independence. We took note of this, and later that night waged a fullscale offensive against ImperialScourge. Ethereals (_d(^_^)b_) at that point managed to defeat cyph in what has to be seen as an upset and IMPS was demoralized for a bit.
<br />

<br />
However, all was not well when, yet again GA joins in. Eventually, we managed to defend ourselves one alst time with Bia (Krista (#505)) being defleeted and retiring. and Houston, XiangXiang (#65) being defleeted and raped, but not killed. I had decided already that I would retire yet again (worst mistake I made all set) and suicided on naru right before, killing only cruisers, as was to be expected. In the morning when I woke up, Houston had come back and killed goodie (Serenity #52) and ahosea (Rainmaker #228) and the rest were not looking much better, But, ASC still had power in our other sector and KNight (Jounin) managed to repel the offendors once more, at this point I created my next character, Sailor Moon, a xerusian. This char however did not last long as it was plagued by bugs making it unplayable. Eth was defleeted and injured severely and instead of dying, he retired. As did dvs, who prior had been player 10? i believe. They restarted as AMD and Intel (dvs---eth) and were soon battle ready once again. In one final conflict, IMPS gathered up and managed to take down the koreans, and what remained of Ascension in the process. This leaving only Smartguy ( - (#814)) and Apoc to defend, they ended up fusing into NC remnants (Darkness falls) and ascension seemingly disbanded.
<br />

<br />
However, once again Eth and myself retired. Myself as Wo Ai Ni (#1746) and Ethereals as GeForce. I hid out with the koreans, helping them in their wars and building up while what remained of Ascension (dvs-AMD ahosea-rainmaker and eth-GeForce) still continued to truck along. Those of us that remained gathered up for end set ranks a small fraction of what we were.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Alright, there only seems to be a GA account of the set missing in here, so here it goes:
<br />

<br />
The beginning of GA:
<br />
GA was formed 2 sets ago, when the whole 'oppression by VH' thing was going on...basically a pile of vets got together and joinged in with HC to make a big group to help take down the VH guys...working alongside this group were NC/AGOD with Cyph being the primary contact. When VH fell, those from the mismatched group who had banded together to go against VH stuck together, mainly because the councils they originally came from (CR, HC, AVN, etc) were not as big as they were in their haydays, so sticking together was good. We became enemies with AGOD after that, and some battles were waged. We had eben playing with HC in the alliance, with Chaoslord being one of the primary players, but things turned bad near the end of the set with ChaosLord NAPing with Cyph and refusing to hit....some of us became fed up with this, as we were interested in always challenging the other top councils, rather than doing the usual 'nap/Ally everyone else big to avoid war' syndrom.....so a pile of us split off..eventually forming what became GA (Azdgari, Houston, Bia, Ben, Aldjoutte, dragush, sapphire, and AVn lads (clyde and archon primarily..others came too))
<br />

<br />
Fast forward to this set: 
<br />
Those mentioned above who split off from HC decided to continue on together as challengers to the often stalemate which happens at the top. Some of those who we were close to did not follow us after the whole shinanigans at the end of the previous set (darkfyre being a notable one). We formed IRC channels and a forums to keep track of members and keep good communication lines. 
<br />

<br />
All in all, we had quite a few members, though maybe only a core 10 or little more which were very active. 
<br />

<br />
The set started out all right, with us getting some footholds. But we quickly started to run into problems: ASC found out who some of us were and decided that they would oppress us. To add to this, The koreans decided to bash us a bit, as well as AGOD/NC. We were under siege quite a bit by any one of these 3 groups, or sometimes more than one at a time. As well, as would often be the situation, a declaration by one of these quick starters was followed by mass declarations by noobs trying to pick up the pieces. We eventually though managed to build up, as some of our members were able to stay hidden and under the radar, which led to further support and build up.
<br />

<br />
Things were starting to look up, but, as often happens in AS, old friends come back again. At this point Kr and NC were a bit above us and stopped causing us much trouble. Everyone once and a while someone would come around for a block or something, but not to bad. Our main problem became ASC. ASC was declaring on us essentially around the clock, and we could expect daily declarations of 1-2 ASC councils on a GA group. With ASC being hit by outside gorups the wars often swung back and forth..with us winning the battles and raping a lot one day, while losing the next. For the most part, the AVN guys were able to stay clear (Clyde--&gt;Taffy #17, Archon--&gt;Jack Sparrow #136, Eddie--&gt;Eddie, before becoming Sammo #11). Some GA started retiring, with a lot restarting, which made us weaker in the tech race, but which was necessary due to constantly being targeted. This meant that at one point,t here were only about 4-5 of us who hadn't retired, who had good tech and developing good fleets. 
<br />

<br />
ASC started facing their own probs, and that didn't bother us at all. Being weak by the constant warring, we were in not much shape to be very offensive. But tips started pouring in. The one that everyone seems to knwo about now was from Ken. With his tipoff, we were able to help kill off Seif, more for our own mutual benefit, than for the service of others. As ASC was under siege, we would jump in to help do what we could to damage and weaken them, hoping that by doing so, we would be able to build back up with less threat. Through IRC we were getting tips nearly constantly from various sources which I will not elaborate on, seeking some assistance in raping. They ahd the fleets for the most part, we had the numbers and lower power level. This led to some mutual collaboration to 'hit them when they are down', as others hit ASC and then KR. 
<br />

<br />
These times were not without their setbacks....waking up one morning and going to my lab to do some experiments, I logged onto an internet connected computer in the lab to see that i had been nearly raped to death overnight. I was close to retiring, but decided that I would just stop playing for a tiny bit...a short time later i decided to go on a killing spree, raping back some of what i lost, and tasking from others to build back. 
<br />

<br />
My memory being kind of muddled with all the school stuff taking AS timeline space, and the fact that things were happening quite like the movie 'groundhog' day, i will sum up what i remember (be it perfectly accurate, or messed up in order a bit) above:
<br />

<br />
GA would build up a bit, we'd be hit by various councils, mainly ASC, but also KR and NC, build up a bit more, the same would happen again, we'd get a tip off that some KR, or ASC were defleeted/stationed/about to be defleeted, and we would jump on them, ASC would rebuild and come back after us, and the whole cylce continues. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, at one point ASC becomes nearly wiped off the map of AS for the set, and we are able to grow and prosper a bit. There are some other hassles, but things look alright. There would follow some strikes on Kr, picking on KR that went out alone, raping KR which got defleeted, you name it, etc. Slowly the number of Kr started to drop until the situation with rapir happened. 
<br />

<br />
Once KR fell, GA and IMPS didn't talk much, though we left them alone and didn't siege or attack them much due to our relationship beside each other during the wars with KR and ASC. Darkness Falls develops and we were seriously considering going after them, but they developed power quite rapidly and had quite a few armadas stacked up. One person who starte dbecoming a pain in the ass and a threat was Psycho Mantis(a Xezp with lots of fast firing fleets) in Darkness Falls, with constant blocking of us. The mantis runs into a problem. Mantis decides to pick on AldJoutte (Outfi #226), and is destroyed by his NRL. Siezing the opprotunity to possibly destroy his remaining fleets, i declare hostile on him and remove his 8 fleets of allieds (since he only leaves a single C fleet to defend)...after talking with other GA, we decide to declare on DF to attack Mantis. Ben (Guybrush Threepwood #135), Strossus (Gambit #1357), and myself (XiangXiang #65) being the three main rapers. We fortidfied ourselves as well as highlander, since we would all be in range of the big guys of DF. unfortunately, though Redjack hadn't been talking on IRC for a while, he was eitehr around or summoned, as was the rest of DF, and everyone was fortified fairly well. They did leave a few of their members with only 19-20 fleets of dooms total, but seeing as how we had told RJ we were only going after a specific member, and they were all online, we sent RJ the truce he asked us to send, and defluffed and retreated. 
<br />

<br />
Over the next few days, we built back up, while some of us went on blocking sprees, and started to hit the empire. As the empire neared 4 planets left, I was asked by Strossus to declare on a fewq big councils for fun, and responded by declaring on all councils in range (the top 6-7 councils), assuming that the empire would fall. The only real threats were DF, IMPS, and our friends in Metatron. After sieging forts and emp planets, i wa sleft with only 14 fleets, some of which were mangled up pretty badly, but no worries, the empire would fall soon. After getting to 130 planets or so (up from 92) from sieging New Alliance members, and assuming everything would be over, i logged off. When I woek up the enxt morning, New Alliance had finally broken me after crashing on me 3 or 4 times, and had raped me, along with a Darkness Falls guy or two to 36 planets. The set ended shortly after i came out of protection.
