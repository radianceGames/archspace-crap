Archspace Basics
<br />

<br />

<br />
Archspace is extremely complicated so don’t expect to start playing and completely get it. I’ve been playing this game off and on since its original creation by Maritel a number of years ago and I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. That could be because it is being constantly updated and modified or it could be that it is just a very in depth game. Everything that follows is just my attempt to try and explain the game and the different aspects that make it up. I will update it with new information or more accurate information as I come across it. If parts of this use terms or theories that aren’t obvious from previous parts of the document or the section you’re reading please tell me and I’ll update it to better explain what I mean. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Generic Overview 
<br />

<br />
A generic overview of the game is that it is a space game about controlling planets, making alliances, working with your fellow council members, making fleets, and bringing down the empire. This is a war game and there is no getting around it. Even if you try to stay peaceful and stay out of the war by the end of the game you WILL be dragged into one or more. Archspace is what is called a tick based game not a turn based game. The difference being that in a turn based game every X minutes you get a turn and you can accumulate a pool of them and spend them when you sign on, though there is a max to the number of turns you can have in that pool. A tick based game is where you set up actions to happen and every X minutes a turn happens and you work towards the previously set goal. For example you could set it so that you build 100 gunboats and maybe every turn you build 5 that means every X minutes when a turn happens you will build 5 gunboats until you have built 100. Turns in Archspace happen every five minutes. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Race 
<br />

<br />
Your first big decision is what race to choose. I’m not sure which race is the best to start with, but hopefully I’ll be able to update this once I get some feedback from different people on this document. Until then I would say choose a race whose abilities sound appealing to you and your personality, if you like being diplomatic and not so war like choose a race with a diplomacy bonus or if you like fighting choose one with a military bonus. When you’re first starting the game it might be a wise idea to stick with one race so that you can focus on the other aspects of the game and get a handle on those before you start jumping from race to race. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Being Active 
<br />

<br />
You should check Archspace at least once a day preferably the more the better. I personally check the game four times a day, once in the morning before work, a second time on my lunch break, a third time when I get back from work, and one last time before I go to bed. Usually though I end up checking many times throughout the evening just because I’m home, but I try to keep it to at least four times. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Diplomacy between Council Members 
<br />

<br />
In the beginning of the game you want to make sure that you go into your diplomacy page and make sure you are set to auto-accept Pacts and Alliances. The more of each that you have the more planets you have access to trade with, thus meaning the more money you make every turn. Also, when it comes to council politics you should not be attacking or spying on the other people that are in your council. They are your friends and teammates, the only people that will help you if you are attacked. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Empire Diplomacy 
<br />

<br />
Also a very harsh lesson I recently learned is that you should always try to keep a good standing with the empire, the more the better. It is good in many different ways, for one the empire won’t ever have a reason to attack you. I recently made the empire very angry by ignoring there demands, so they attacked me when I only had 100 doomstars against there 600 doomstars (Doomstars being the largest ships that you can build). I’m hoping to get the developers to change the amount of power that is used to slap someone on the wrist when they’ve been bad. The best way to get a good standing with the empire is to donate 20 million into there pockets every day, but 2 million also works good. You can use your relation with the empire to your advantage in many ways. Besides the fact that the empire won’t attack you, you will also be able to ask for things. You can ask for boons which vary in there effect but can be anything from money to a new planet. Also you can request them to step in and stop a war for you, very useful when you’re losing. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
What Are These Buildings? 
<br />

<br />
Factories produce Production Points which determines how much money a planet makes, but that can be modified by how many pacts and alliances you have, Research Labs generate Research Points that are spent to research technologies that give you bonuses through projects or by more powerful components to your ships, and Military Bases generate Military Points that are spent to upkeep ships. NOTE: Military Bases DO NOT determine how quickly you build ships. The time it takes to build ships is determined by your income and your Military Control Model (CM). Your different CMs can be found on your Domestic page, these numbers are changed by buying projects. The amount of points that each building produces every turn can be modified by what is called a Planetary Attribute, either a negative or a positive. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Starting Strategy 
<br />

<br />
You start the game with a few fleets and they can be used in many ways. One of those fleets should be sent out on expeditions every time it is available to go out on one. When a fleet comes back from an expedition it will “bring back” a planet for you to control and it will also gain a chunk of experience for going out and coming back. Your other two starting fleets should be used for defense, training commanders, or for attacking, it all depends on what is happening with the council your in. 
<br />
Whenever you get a new planet you should invest money into it so that it builds buildings quicker and the atmosphere changes to one that is more suitable to your race more quickly. Also in the beginning of the game when you’re researching you should always have money invested in researching new techs, when you are determined to build ships and you need them fast you should invest in ship building. I recommend setting your home planet to 100% factories just because it’s the only planet that can never be destroyed or lost without dieing, thus you don’t get stuck with any research buildings that eventually will be pointless when you’re completed with all your researching. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
What Buildings Should I build? 
<br />

<br />
In the beginning of the game whenever you get Rich or Ultra-Rich planets you should set those to 100% factories. Normal planets can be done a few different ways the best two would be 50% factories with either 50% military bases or research labs, if it was me it would be research labs in the beginning and then be military bases when I was done researching. Poor or Ultra-Poor planets should have no Factories on it and only Research Labs or Military Bases. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Researching 
<br />

<br />
You should concentrate on researching technologies until they are all completed because the more techs that you have the more of an advantage you will have over everyone else. Keep your researching in Free Research because its quicker than picking each tech, only choose your techs if you KNOW that what it gives you when you complete it is really worth it. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
In Depth Gameplay 
<br />

<br />
A major part of this game is being able to design your own ships, and not just something small like size or name, you get it all. You decide armor type, what weapons, how many, and special devices. There are many choices in all of the above categories to choose from which means that this is yet another part of the game that is difficult to get the hang of and it’ll take a lot of time, thought, and testing to find the right combinations for the right races. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Commanders 
<br />

<br />
Once you have built ships you need to put them under a commander who will lead them into battle. Your commanders are gained at a rate determined by your military CM, thus the more of a CM you have the more commanders you get. How good they are is determined by your Genius CM, also the higher the better. You commanders have levels starting at level 1 and going up to level 20. The higher his level the more ships he can have under his command and the better he’ll be able to lead them. Your commanders have abilities that determine how well they do different attacks, defend against different attacks, how well they maneuver there ships during combat, and how well they can lead an armada of many different commanders and fleets into combat. Commanders also have two additional traits that act as modifiers to there starting abilities, when you start to get more in depth with the game you’ll want to match certain ship designs with a certain type of commander. Let’s take the big bad end game weapon, Homing Black Hole, it is a missile so you’d want to match your ships that mainly have Homing Black Holes on them with commanders that have a modifier called “Missile Specialist” which adds 25% damage to missiles, WHOA. It is important to match the right commanders with the right ships, but in the beginning of the game there are too many things to pay attention to so you might just want to not immediately care about all the specific details and just choose commanders that have little to no negative modifiers. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
WAR!!! 
<br />

<br />
Eventually you will get in a war and this next part will hopefully help you out. When on defense you’ll eventually need to use tactics that work better depending on the race you’re playing, but until that point I’ll give you a few general thoughts that have done alright for me. One strategy is to have a few ships out in front of your main force when your ships go into battle, if the fleets up front have a high detection they’ll fire first at the enemy ships and then there front troops will fire all of there weapons and when those weapons are recharging your main force will show up and decimate there troops. Make sure though that your front line isn’t made up of your best ships keep those safe in the back. You can avoid having to make your front line up of commanders that have a high detection once you get the device “Cloaking Field”, this will keep your ships invisible until they fire there first shot. That guarantees that no matter what your first line of ships get there shots off before the other player’s. Another could be to keep most of your fleet but have a few ships upfront to “Un-Cloak” there cloaked ships then your main attack shows up and blows them away. Obviously there are other strategies, so once I make it farther in this game I’ll update this section. But no matter what your attacking strategy you should keep a few ships around for stealing player’s planets and scouting there formations. The specific components of the design don’t matter, the only thing that does is that you should make it a level 5 (Cruiser) ship, this is just to make sure that they can attack any planet no matter what galaxy its in. When someone has no fleets left you use a fleet with only two ships in it to take there planets, the reason for two ships is because one will die when you take the planet. These are good because they are very useful for taking planets and they don’t count a lot towards your overall power. When I say scouting I mean you send in a fleet of only two ships to see their formation before you do a major attack. It doesn’t really matter that they die because the ships aren’t useful and you only put them under the command of a trashy commander so you’re not worried about the commander either. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Tactics 
<br />

<br />
When gaining more and more planets and researching you’ll have to watch out and make sure that you don’t get too many planets. You wouldn’t think that owning lots of planets would be a bad thing, but it can be if you don’t keep building higher leveled ships with updated components. When you don’t build enough ships to the amount of planets that you are acquiring you become “Planet Fat”, just like in other games where it might be called “Land Fat” it means that you have too many holdings compared to the size of your military. You should check the Ranking Page located under the Info tab to determine if you are getting too “Planet Fat”. At the top of the page you can filter the ranking listing by different categories like Overall Power, Fleet Power, Planet Power, and Tech Power. You should always try and keep your Fleet Power ranking better than your Overall Power, thus to prevent becoming “Planet Fat”. This will help you in two ways; First off it’ll mean that if someone does attack you the thing that makes you powerful is your military not your holdings. Second if you lose, it’ll make you reach protection quicker. Protection starts once a certain amount of your power is lost in a short amount of time. The empire will send “fleets” to protect you, which really means that there are no “actual” fleets there its just that no one can attack you for 12 hours, but if you attack someone else during this period it will end your protection. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
More Tactics??? 
<br />

<br />
Once you start getting some Rich and Ultra-Rich planets you’ll want to start building your “Inner Core” followed by your “Outer Core”. This business of cores comes from the fact that when you attack another player you can only siege the last half of an opponent’s planets, so if you had 36 planets when you get attacked they can attack planets 19-36. What you want is to have your Rich and Ultra-Rich planets make up your “Inner Core” and your crappy planets making up your “Outer Core”. To get your Rich and Ultra-Rich planet closer to your home planet you can do it one of two ways; one you could destroy any crappy planets between your good planets and your home planet thus brining it closer to your Home Planet. The second would be to have a “friend” or council member siege your crappy planets while your fleets are away and then siege them back from that individual while his fleets are gone. That works because whenever you get a planet from someone or somewhere else it is placed furthest away from your Home Planet. If this is used in conjunction with keeping your fleet ranking above your planet ranking then this then you’ll reach protection without really losing anything important at all. Let’s use someone having 20 planets as an example to show you what I mean. If your fleet power makes up most of your power then when you get attacked and you lose you’ll lose tons of power and be really close to protection and you would have lost one crappy planet. After that initial attack you have no fleet and one less planet, the attacker or attackers have to take 9 more planets before they even start taking ones that matter to you. If by that point you’re not in protection then it should happen at any time, so at most you lose a few useful planets but I really think that if you lost your entire armada of ships and half of your planets that you would be in protection.

<br />
Let's say for example you have 21 planets(I always have a little extra) and 800 doomstars.
<br />

<br />
This means people can see #11-21
<br />

<br />
You get hit by cyphtor the mighty. You lose 800 doomstars and one planet, you now have 20, people can see 11-20.
<br />

<br />
Lets also say you happen to be at war with a bunch of frenzied lowbies who want to rape you senseless. Since you just barely covered your core...
<br />

<br />
When you have 19 planets, they see 10-19, thus they take one of your core. at 17 it is 8-17, another core planet, 15 = 7-15, another one, 13 = 6 -13....etc, make sense? Your starting level does not determine what they can see all along, so you are not safe for 9 more planets, in actuality, you are safe for 1.
<br />

<br />
Alsso: Protection, losing all your fleets puts you nowhere near protection, it isnt based on power at all, it is based on planets, if you lose more than 70&amp;, you are in protection, in your example of 20, you would have to lose more than 14 planets to go into protection.
