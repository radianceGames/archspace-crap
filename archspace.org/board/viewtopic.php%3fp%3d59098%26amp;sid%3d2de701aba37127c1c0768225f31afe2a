				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">My goodness it's been ages since I've visted the forums here!  Glad Mem caught me on AIM.  As such I endorse the posting of TAC to this forum again!  I am honored that ya'll remembered TAC, and with that in mind here is a new chapter as yet unreleased.  As usual all of The Azguard Chronicles is copywritten by myself 2000-2006, and under constant revision.  (Yes this chapter is raw and unrevised, please bear that in mind.)
<br />

<br />
I hope you enjoy my "novel in the works" as much as I have enjoyed writing it.  Without further ado here is Chapter 13 - Time to Act.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Mazuko sat at his desk awaiting Commander Sterling’s arrival.  He shook his head as he thought of all that was about to transpire.  He knew this would be a crippling effect to his fleets as well as the main fleet body of Azguard.  However it would free up many citizens and allow them to choose to fight for Azguard on their own will, or they could be given a habitable planet and left to deal with the Alien Menace on their own.  The choice was theirs.
<br />
Mazuko shook his head in disbelief; he could not believe he was about to take action to remove a close friend from the ranks of Azguard.  He’d fought along side Trigon on many occasions and thought him an extremely honorable man.  An honorable man at least until the most recent chain of events.   He had no other choice, he’d been given an order, and he knew what he had to do.  No matter what he felt for the man personally, he had tried to kill him, well Gak’tul anyways and Maxus.  He smirked as he thought about that day.  Maxus thought himself a king, when in fact Trigon had outfitted another race’s ships with organic armor, which only looked like the new Alien armor, and sent them to their death against his enemy.  Attacking one of Azguards allies was a crime punishable by death and he would have no trouble bringing justice to a man that was not taking this war seriously.  
<br />
Trigon had to die, and he had to figure out a way to accomplish it without causing too much political upheaval. He poured himself another glass of brandy and took a swallow.  Mazuko looked up to the door and waited knowing Commander Sterling was always on time.
<br />

<br />
Max looked all around him; the hallway was beaten and full of pockmarks.  Almost as if this station had had a war within and the losers never left.  He was sure this had to have been the station Mazuko took from Gak’tul in the early days of the war with The Imperial Scourge.  His mind began to wander and he wondered how The Imperial Scourge was fairing in the war with the Aliens now.  Surly they had not been able to hold onto the outermost planets of their cluster, but as for their home planet, he knew for sure every citizen of The Imperial Scourge would die before that happened.  
<br />
Max made his way further into the bowls of the giant space station.  The name of the station escaped him at the moment, and it had been blown off the side in another battle.  To Mazuko paint was useless; it never dried in space and in war it came off too easily.  The only identifiable mark on any of the ships in Mazuko’s fleets was the emblem of Azguard.  The emblem was a bright moon in the background with a lone Doomstar drifting in front of it.  The mere thought of such an emblem was not too bothersome, however when one got closer they could see why it was one of the most feared and respected emblems in the entire known universe.
<br />

<br />
Max finally made his way to the mess hall, there had to have been hundreds of men in that hall.  As he made his way past it he heard stories of things past, some of which he himself had done.  The men talked with gusto about the legends and great feats of Azguards greatest Commanders.  He heard one story in particular, one in which he had never heard before.  The man claimed Gak’tul lived and that he had seen him with his own eyes!  The man was shouting above the noise gathering quite a crowd as they listened to his tale.
<br />
“I swear by the God’s Gak’tul lives!  I am a personal aid to Maxus himself!  I have PROOF that Gak’tul is aiding The Human Alliance in their preparations for war!  Gak’tul is one of Azguards greatest enemies and yet The Human Alliance a now open ally of Azguard has him at their side!  Azguard will fall to the hands of the mighty The Human Alliance!”
<br />
As the man continued to shout guards seized him and took him to the ground dragging him out of the mess hall.  The strange man was kicking and screaming like a baby as he was being removed always screaming about The Human Alliance’s superiority over Azguard and that Azguard would be destroyed.  Max shook his head; he figured the man was being taken into the ally to have his head smashed in by the local guards.  After all the station was under martial law.
<br />
He took note of the situation and got some information on the man from one of the cooks and a few of the troops there, he was sure Gak’tul was dead but he had to be certain. He finally headed off for his meeting, late.
<br />

<br />
Mazuko polished off his glass of Brandy and checked his watch.  Commander Sterling was 20 minutes late something must have come up.  Should he send out a patrol for him?  No, he thought to himself.  I’m going to give him another ten minutes.  He is a very reliable Commander.  As he was puzzling away at what could have happened to Commander Sterling the holophone on his desk rang.
<br />
Mazuko picked up and said, “Go ahead this is Mazuko.”
<br />
“Pardon me Sir,” said the secretary, “there has been a situation in the mess hall.”
<br />
“A situation?  What kind of situation?”  He was now getting quite concerned, could this have been what happened to Commander Sterling?  He knew there was a few The Human Alliance supporters on the station, that is why he instituted martial law, but what could have caused this?  
<br />
“The personal aid of Maxus himself somehow made his away onto the station and started quite the racket in the mess hall.  Proclaiming he personally saw Gak’tul alive and that he was aiding The Human Alliance in their defense” Said the secretary.
<br />
“How the hell?  We put a halt to letting outsiders on this station how the hell did he get on board?”  His mind was racing; he had to know what happened.  The only thing running through his mind now was it had to be a security leak.  What else could it be?  The names of a hundred security personnel ran through his head as he tried to pick out the mostly likely candidates for such a problem.  He could only narrow it down to two people, but they had died in the battle with the “Alien” fleet in defense of The Human Alliance’s fleets.
<br />
“He was smuggled aboard on a merchant ship Sir.”
<br />
“I see.  Put him in the brig after you silence him.  Reprogram him as one of our ground troops.  Also seize that merchant vessel and all of its cargo as…” Mazuko chuckled to himself “…war time necessities, what ever they are.”
<br />
“Yes Sir.” At that the holophone shutoff and there was a knock at the door.
<br />

<br />
Mazuko quickly took a seat at his desk and shouted.  “Come in Commander Sterling.”  The door opened slowly and Commander Sterling stepped in.
<br />
“How did you know it was me Sir?” said Max.
<br />
“Your late.”
<br />
“I can explain.”  Max quickly thought to himself how the hell was he going to explain being late to his Commander?  He couldn’t tell him he was caught up in watching a man get dragged away and beaten by the guards.  He couldn’t tell him he stopped at the mess hall to listen to a story!  A frigging story for crying out loud!  That’s no reason to be late for a meeting with your COMMANDER!  But what choice did he have?  It was either lie to his Commander OR tell him what happened.  Obviously he had to tell Mazuko the reason WHY he was late.  Somehow Mazuko seemed to know what he was thinking.  Perhaps he had Psi implants?  Who knew…there were rumors though.
<br />
“I was tied up at the mess hall Sir.”
<br />
“I’m assuming you were caught up in watching a man claiming himself to be the personal aid of Maxus tell a story about Gak’tul being alive and aiding the The Human Alliance war effort?”
<br />
How the hell did he know all of this?  He wasn’t there!  No wonder he’s a very sought after Commander, he’s damn good at what he does!  Commander Sterling could now see how Mazuko had not disappeared as many Azguardians believed.  He ENJOYED his work, and that alone gave men reason enough to follow him into the depths of hell itself.  
<br />
“That would be correct Sir.”
<br />
“Very well,” Mazuko gestured to a chair in front of his desk  “take a seat Commander we have much to prepare for you and I.”
<br />
“Excuse me Sir?” what the hell was Mazuko talking about?  He had all the men he needed to carry out his orders what would he have to do with me?  Hmmm the only thing I can think is that it would have to be a mission of some sort.  A mission for what though?  Are we going to hunt down and kill Gak’tul once and for all?  
<br />
“You look as if you are confused Commander, to answer what I am sure you are thinking, yes you and I have a mission to accomplish.  We are leaving at 0200 hours so I suggest we prepare immediately!”
<br />
“Yes Sir. But Sir?”
<br />
“Yes Commander?  I suppose you want to know what the main goal of this mission is?  We are taking out a Traitor.  You will get more information as it becomes necessary, at this moment you are on a need to know basis.  In the words of an old friend, the walls have eyes and ears.”
<br />
At this both men began work on the infiltration plans of an Azguard designed Doomstar. No easy task, for they were some of the most secure vessels every built, they had their hands full and only they could accomplish it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Trigon stumbled around the command deck of his flagship, Estrada, in a drunken stupor, a bottle of Cognac in one hand and a picture of Gak’tul in the other.  “CURSE YOU GAK’TUL! You are the sword in my side; YOU are the destroyer of everything I have taken so long to plan.  If it were not for you, Maxus would be dead as I now speak!!” he shouted drunkenly as he stumbled and grabbed the back of a chair to keep from falling.  “I will KILL you with my own two hands Gak’tul you can COUNT ON IT!” he screamed as he threw the now empty Cognac bottle at a radar screen.  It shattered into pieces and Trigon stared at it blindly as it soon burst into flames.. He looked at the picture in his hand and spat upon it.  “You will die.”  He moved to the other side of his command deck and slumped down into a chair.  He sighed to himself
<br />
	
<br />

<br />
	Marianna spoke softly into her transmitter as the automatic repair robots began fixing the now torched radar console.  “Trigon has drunken himself into a stupor yet again Sir, I do not yet know when he will call for me I must be prepared to answer.”  
<br />
“Very well M-3, do what you must.  We will be there within the hour.”
<br />
“Understood, M-3 out.”
<br />

<br />
	Commander Sterling shook his head.  Had Mazuko gone mad?  He was talking to himself again calling himself M-3 whatever the hell that meant.  Was it some sort of code?  Max shook his head how could he have been so dumb.  This man mesmerized him, the stories he had heard of the feats Mazuko had accomplished were great.  All of which did him no justice, because not one of them knew the real truth..  But he was no writer; he would do this man no justice either.  Were his thoughts wandering again?  They had to be, where the hell did he get the idea of being a writer from?  “Hmmmmm” Max muttered under his breath.  He was thoroughly perplexed by this.  What was he thinking about in the first place? He looked to Mazuko with confusion in his eyes.
<br />
	“Commander,” he whispered “what am I doing here.”
<br />
	Mazuko cursed under his breath he had forgotten to give Commander Sterling the dampening shield he would need to get past the slave matrix.  He should have known.  Fortunately for Max he had Command Sterling put an extra one in his pack.  Mazuko gestured with his hand for Max to turn around and face his back to him.  Max looked confused but he still seemed to have some of his sanity left.  He was not yet a slave of Trigon.  Mazuko rummage through Max’s pack until he came upon the dampening shield he was looking for.  He removed it and quickly adjusted its setting before inserting it into Commander Sterling’s arm via the hypodermic needle one used to insert the shield.  He quickly placed the remnants back into Sterling’s sack and told him to turn around.
<br />
	“Look at me Commander,” said Mazuko “you did not inject the dampening shield into your blood stream.  The Slave Matrix Trigon has installed on his vessels nearly took you away from yourself.  Fortunately I had another dampening shield injection placed into your pack for such an emergency.”
<br />
	“Thank you Sir, once again I owe you my life.”  Max managed to spit out.
<br />
	“You owe me nothing Commander Sterling, your being here is payment enough.  We must move out now, Trigon is asleep we should have no problems breaching the hull and making our way inside.”
<br />
	“Affirmative.”
<br />
	”Move out.” Said Mazuko as both men grabbed their gear and headed out of their small craft and fastened them selves to the hull of Trigon’s flagship, Estrada.
<br />

<br />
	Unbeknownst to Mazuko and Max, Trigon had anticipated an infiltration by the Azguard elite.  Albeit he had no idea whom would be initiating the action to remove him from his place of power, he knew it was going to come.  So he had set up a perimeter of ghosts, specially trained soldiers that could blend into anything using a personal cloaking field generator.  It was quite ingenious of him, he thought at the time, to train civilians to do his bidding.  “Why waste good soldiers?” He often said to himself. “When civilians are a dime a dozen? Hell they VOLUNTEER to do this sort of experimentation!”  
<br />
	His highest Commanders often talked amongst themselves about the unwarranted and unjust manner in which Trigon selected his ghost troops.  But who were they to complain?  They were fortunate enough to be alive let alone knowing that they were slaves to this mad man.  Besides the fact they got to toy with the most inhumane war machines ever released upon mankind.  They often wondered as to why Trigon refused to make slaves of any of the other many races that the mighty Azguard had come into contact with.  It was up to them to wonder and only one man to know the answer.
<br />
	In addition to the ghosts Trigon had dispatched observation vessels and had the hull cameras activated on his flagship Estrada.  He knew what was going to happen and he knew it would.  If only he had known when, how, and who would be carrying out this operation he would be able to thwart them easily.  However Azguards security had been tightened as of late and it made it rather difficult to get a hold of any information pertaining to Azguard secret operations or even standard military operations of any sort for that matter.  Not since the attempt on Maxus and Gak’tul had been made.  Perhaps it had been a mistake to try so quickly and to be so bold and brazen as to his attack on Maxus’s flagship.  Too many people knew it was he that made the attack, yet he was surprised Mastermind had not yet displaced him from the military course he took with the Azguard main fleet body.  It was a strange scenario in which he had become merely a pawn when it was he whom had set things into motion.
<br />

<br />
	“BREEEEP BREEEEP BREEEEP” the alarm on Estrada repeated over and over again.  It was the hull breach alarm something obviously had breached her hull.  “BREEEEP BREEEEP BREEEEP” Trigon literally jumped out of his seat on the sixth round of the alarm the drunken stupor he was in quickly fading away as he was ready for action.  He quickly grabbed the speakerphone and spoke “DAMAGE REPORT, DAMAGE REPORT!” shouted Trigon.  
<br />
	There was a moment of silence before there was an answer.  “The munitions room has been breached Sir.  There was an external explosion we lost two decks to the blast sir.  The air locks have been sealed casualties number in the thousands!” shouted one of Estrada’s engineers.
<br />
	“Blast it! The time has come!  To your battle stations men!” Trigon turned to the door as his crew flooded into the communications center in which he had been.  They all rushed to their positions the green screens coming to life as the light in the room dimmed.  They were ready for anything, and all thanks to Trigon’s mind control devices.
<br />

<br />
	Trigon smiled to himself, he knew he was safe and he knew nothing was going to get past his heavily defended position.  He once again picked up and spoke over the speakerphone “Give me a status report gentlemen” said Trigon calmly.
<br />
	“Sir it seems an asteroid struck the side of the Estrada Sir.  As I said before it took out two decks and took exactly 2316 lives.  The shields are online again Sir and we are ready for war.  Repairs will be needed soon however, for we are running low on energy reserves.”
<br />
	“I see.  We will dock with the main station in the morning.  Stand down men it was a false alarm.  We lost a lot of men today,” he mumbled to himself “as if I cared” “, and that loss is great.  An asteroid struck us and repairs are under way as we speak.  Return to your duties.”
<br />
	Trigon shook his head in disbelief he could have sworn that he was being attacked but apparently he was wrong.  He laughed loudly and headed for his office, he had another bottle of Cognac waiting for him.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
