			  			What if Doom couldn't hit Gunboat (too small for big guns {u all seen starwars i guess}) or have real trobble hitting it, it would enforce player to bring other ships into battle.<br />
<br />
Lets nm' the ships from 1 to 10<br />
1 is gunboat<br />
10 is doom<br />
<br />
Now lets say for example that ship nm x<br />
can't hit ship nm x-9 teel x-7.<br />
And have 25% chance hitting ship nm x-6<br />
<br />
So now Dooms can't hit Gunboats teel Frigates,<br />
and have difficult hitting Destroyers.<br />
So now player with Dooms will want to bring in some Cruiser to battle, or the battle will end in drow cause after 1800 turn the small ship can't make enough dmg to Dooms, and Dooms can't fight back. Now a weak player that knows of that startegy and can't build dooms yet, will try to build ships larger than cruiser, in order to knock out the crusier first,but... the strong player will know it so he'll probebly put his dooms at the first line to prevent it, the weak player will think of it and he'll put his Gunboat in first line and his battle ships (that know how to kill cruiser) in flanking position.<br />
<br />
I know every one here talk about strategy so I have looked for it. I looked at the real big players battle reports for the last week, and beside massing Dooms neer your capital fleet I haven't seen much, and don't tell me that putting the right commi in the right fleet is strategy, well it is, but there got to be more than that.<br />
I must say that I saw one player that I realy enjoy see his fighting skills but even there, the battle was lucking.<br />
<br />
It was just a thought how to make the game more intresting.<br />
<br />
I would like to get some comments.						<P align=right> </P>

			  	it wud be tite to be able to make some kinda like plan to attack others with... like circling around the back while the other guys ships are distracted by frontal fire... and the like have ships stay together so that the fast ships dont leave the slow ships and get all shot up... and you should be able to place your ships so they can take advantage of commanders and weapons and stuff<br />
<br />
that would make a good game			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Well actually, there are uses for smaller ship sizes. But I won't get into that.<br />
<br />
Currently the reason behind it being all doomstar wars at the high level (this is kinda late-game anyway...) is due to the capping the maximum offensive capability to 20 fleets and most people will only defend with 20-30 fleets, which is done for good reason: Changing this limit would vastely increase the size of battle reports and take more processing time. Besides, ultimately, the bigger guys are going to have more of EVERY ship class than everyone else still. It's still a pointless path. Ultimately you'll just use your dooms to take out the big stuff first, and then send in cruisers and crap to finish them off. But that could be gay, because they could drop too much power from the big ship loss, and you'd gain no planet. That would entirely screw the entire system in place.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it doesn't make any sense that in Archspace, at this point in the game, pretty much everyone has reached the plateau of research and technology. We're not talking cannons anymore. Besides, if hitting small ships was really an issue, I'm sure that if you wanted to use a big ship class over a small you'd equip them with like Anti-Fighter Torpedos or something with blast radius of mucho largness. It's fine how it, for now. And there's still the whole basic rule: If you shoot enough crap at it, it's gonna get hit. Very often those dooms waste SHITLOADS of HBH on hitting GBs. It's like trying to take out some terrorists or criminals with nukes. You're gonna kill them, end of story. :P Blast radius!<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY, you can't see plainly what ship class you enemy is using. Would it not be gay if you had to sit there attacking with different ship classes to kill your enemy? Having to make destroyers to kill their gunboats that you thought were doomstars? Or they switch to a little frigate/gunboat collection right before you hit and you dooms can't hit, your smaller crap gets killed? GAY. You'd spend all day trying to get a few stupid planets. Besides, ultimately you can still pump out loads of stupid little ships if needed. That's not an issue. If you want to play that kind of a game I suggest a new game. :/<br />
<br />
Alot of people undererstimate how complex the AS battle system is. There's also more involved strategy outside of invididual battles themselves.<br />

			  	Puting a limit of 20 fleet it's a great thing, cause it will make u choose carfuly what kind of ships u'll put in your armada. And why not making the game a bit more chalnging when u tring to conquer a planet. so let the man build a fleet of 800 Dooms, 800 cruiser and 800 GB and risk his power to get to much up.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the idea of ship that are to small of being shot, is just a feature that can help to rich the game strategy, it may be illogic the same as conquer a planet with 2 cruisers.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY, i don't know much about the AS battle system, but i don't think it will be so hard to tell Doom to ignore GB and just continue flying looking for other target, and for the issue of not knowing what kind of ship it is, this is the fun of planing your moves before the fight by thinking what the enemy defence plan will be.<br />
And if u spand all day and steal loose, u must be planing the wrong way.<br />
<br />
And finaly i just want to tell about a fight of one of the top player i saw today, 700 ship (probably Dooms) against 400 (also big ships)<br />
guess how it went, it went like it always goes; cube of Doom aganist smaller cube of dooms,<br />
and u can say that he put ballistic commis for DB, missle commis for HBH and hi detection in front line.<br />
battle is also movment, desiving and put all your weapon at the right place at the right time, where do we see all of that.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	cyph is right about blowing up 1 guy with a nuke if you shoot 700 HBH you are going to kill a little ship even without acurracy, and no offense but some of your complaints seem to come across as coming from someone whos never been toward the top before, becuase honostly none of the top players want this stuff implemented and there is more stratagy than people realize as cyph said. 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	NONE OF THE TOP PLAYERS WANT THIS STUFF IMPlEMENTED...?<br />
Maybee the top players want to be left, playing alone...<br />
<br />
I know my ideas will make the players that are at the top, harder time to stay there including my self, if i'll ever get there (give me a little time, i have been here only for 2 weaks), I'm not thinking otherwise.<br />
<br />
I don't know how hard it is to get to the top, I saw the top players putting wonderful team work, and this is one of the reason they are at the top, so i guess it's preaty hard.<br />
But... ones they are there, i think it's preaty hard to get there later.<br />
<br />
Finaly, I don't know how long this game is exist, but i heard that there were many sets already. I think that one of the reason this game is not evolving (get more player then it already has), is because when a new player get here, he find out how hard it is to give a good battle, when u get trashed random by players twice your size just to keep u low.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	ave, this game has been around for over 4 years, it did die, and recently the game has revived. The fact of the matter is ur idea will not make it harder for vets to stay on top, vets are on the top because they can cordinate attacks and defense, plain and simple. Smaller ships do have improved mobility which does increase their defense rate btw. This game isn't going to evolve much rlly, its out of beta, its matured, just add features here and there, but nothing that would tottally reshape the game, like having a static map of planets for example.<br />
<br />
As far as setting up complex defense and attack plans beyond the current scope, devs have worked on a few ideas. One was to allow scriptability - but unfortunately most people couldn't code qbasic to add numbers. Some people talk about how orders is broken, i believe this has to do with that fact the engine treats all the fleets as a strategic whole, and not as seperate squads. Ideally it would be good to put fleets in a squad, and give the squads orders. There has been though about stacking orders, but the question is how do u let the gamer decribe when the next set of orders kick in? again with the scripting :(<br />
<br />
I forgot the name of it... but there is a game soley based on programming a bot and battling it out online. It has a gui development environment, and still most players are clueless. So until programming becomes a mandatory class in the world, or some sort of super AI is developed, i don't see a very good solution other then squad ability + more preprogrammed orders (ie, fake flee)<p><br>&lt;zbyte645795&gt;	so tita, there is two of me!<br />
&lt;zbyte645795&gt;	one to pimp out<br />
&lt;zbyte64&gt;	the other to keep to urself<br />

			  	Ok i just have something to say here...<br />
If you had a doomstar, wouldn't all those guns actually have difficulty MISSING a gunboat? And what about things like &gt;Homing&lt; Black Hole, or Kamikaze &gt;Concious&lt; Torpedo? And with beams, missing is only possible from insane non-attack range distances. And projectiles travel too damn fast to have difficulty.<p><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />

			  	just multiply the velocity of the blackhole to the size and volume of the gunboat, and divide by PI <br />
<br />
shouldnt be to hard to calculate damage<p><br>____________________________<br />

			  	I don't know, it was just a suggetion, it's like real radar, that can lock on an airplain, but can't lock on, bird.<br />
<br />
but it can detect and lock on, on many birds that are close to each other.<br />
<br />
You keep thinking why it's not logic (there are many thing in this game that already not, and it's not bother any one) insted of how to make the game more fun.			   <P align=right></P>

It's just a game, the coders can do what ever they want, they can even name HBH diffrent, like super pircing mislles, that will have the same attribute, but won't sound so... explosive.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	indeed, black holes kinda sound a bit large! and the fact that in the doomstar text it says thay they cant go near planets without disruptin the gravity and stuff, so wats the point in sendin them to capture new planets? the programers need to sort out the inconsistancys...

Just think of it as unstable black holes, if memory serves me correctly, some scientists in europe managed to temporarly create a singularity.<p><br>&lt;zbyte645795&gt;	so tita, there is two of me!<br />

			  	Hi... I understand your points of view my friends... but I will expose my situation.. I have started to play archpace 3 days ago, and some kind of &quot;evil&quot; council declared war on me... Theoricately I have the protection cause I haven't attacked or spied yet... But, for example, if I were out of the protection and a guy with some power than me with (i dont know) 50 dooms... How can I fight him???... but the question here is... Can i really fight him??.. or I must to sit tight and wait until he finish his attacks (and that will happen when he took all my planets and got a boost power score)...<br />
<br />
So... I know taht you are very experienced player, and maybe you can answer to all the question that I left on the table..<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks			   <P align=right></P>

			  	You can only be attacked by someone twice your power so if you can be attacked by him, you have a few options at your disposal to fight him, but you are at a huge disadvantage, and basically need to count on him making a mistake to be able to win. If he has 50 dooms, and you are still at cruisers, chances are you two aren't in the same power range bracket so you won't be able to be attacked by him, as ships will add to your power as will tech to a minor extent and as will planets.<br />
<br />
As for building black holes, why would it be dumb? Its just a missle that on impact creates a black hole, or atleast thats what it sounds like to me, and these blackholes are prolly temperorary that collapse after the initial effect, as the mass to create a permenant one would prolly get expensive... unless you got Psi:Matter tech that is :P In any case it should fuck up any ships quite nicely			   <P align=right></P>

			  	To johnnatan, first I know how u feel, you are not the first, and won't be the last.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I wouldn't worry about some one with 50 dooms if I stated 3 days ago, each doom gives about 600 (I think even more) to power rank, so 600X50=30000 plus his planets, so if you true to your power (didn't build to many small ships), after 3 days he can't heart u, I would worry from some one with 2 dooms.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Although you have some well formed ideas,<br />
<br />
Balance wise...this would not be a good fix. Currently, in it's complexity and quirks the AS battle system is one of a kind and requiers immense strategy. I know for certain this is one idea we won't do ^_^. Sorry....<br />

			  	Well, I have been killed again... I cannot pass from third day... This time a council with all his members with 20000-40000 of power attacked me... you can think that my defense was weak... Maybe... But i don't think that my destroyers and frigates could destroys some battleships with ossilation of dissonance and wall of klein ships' components...<br />
<br />
My ships survuved 5 attacks at almost the same time... 5 players attacking at once... My fleets survived 3 rounds... and they survived due to my 8 level commanders... ohh man... tremendous battle that they gave to the battleships... But as you can see they are death now and mee too...<br />
<br />
I created a new account, trying another race... but i don't know many people doesn't know how to play fair... This was a travesty.. 5 against one.. of course... you can guess that when you see that their highest honor were 3 (Evil, If i am not mistaken)...<br />
<br />
Well, can you give a strategy to survive at least 1 week... I cannot fight players with the highest tech.. it's impossible, I can play with them like Tom and Jerry... the cat chasing the mouse...and of course, my main problem is that I'm the Mouse...<br />
<br />
I will need your wisdom and experience... Thanks...<br />
<br />
I will appreciate eny help that you can give to me...			   <P align=right></P>
