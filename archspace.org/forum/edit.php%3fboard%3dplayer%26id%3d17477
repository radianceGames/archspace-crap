The DNS Council Organization

We are an organization of councils allied together in allegiance.
Our councils each operate with different overall tasks and aims.
Currently there are 4 different types of council within the DNS structure.

There are the councils which will hold the more powerful and war-hungry members, the War-Lords councils. These will only accept players who are either relatively experienced or who have completed a specific amount of research. The purpose of the War-Lords is pretty much self-explanatory. The leader of the ‘War-Lords’ councils is one of 2 people wanting the position.

There are the Advanced Training councils.Players that wish to have a reasonably balanced game, where there is some war and peace, may join these councils. The players will remain within these councils until they wish to move to a different section or wish to play a larger role within Advanced Training. The purpose of advanced training is to test their skills, capabilities and best functions, and to also receive any extra experience they require. These councils will be coordinated by Arclite.

Then there are the Beginners Training councils. Any new players to Archspace are welcome into one of these councils to learn the basic principles of Archspace, strategies, help etc. We will give as much starting aid as we can to get new players started. Graduates will be sent to one of the ‘Advanced Training’ councils to gain their experience. This section was inspired by Blaze and the ‘Antioch Garden’. It is advisable that new players first try the Antioch Garden before coming here, and any new players will be offered to Blaze before we train them. However, this section is open for when the Antioch Garden begins to get over crowded or if people would simply prefer to be in the DNS Council Organization. The Beginners Training councils will be led by Conflicter.

Finally there are the Pacifist councils, the councils of peace. These councils are available to anyone who is suffering from war a bit too much and requires a rest. The councils can also be used to build up fleet power while protected from war, however this is not encouraged. The Pacifist Councils will not declare war on any other council, and it is advisable to the other councils not to declare war on them. The Pacifist Councils will be led by someone, Controlling.

There are various titles within the DNS Council Organization each with different responsibilities. Currently we have 3 posts for Executive waiting to be filled. The titles are as follows:

DNS Lord
DNS Executive Speaker
DNS Executive
DNS Speaker
DNS Advanced Trainer
DNS Trainer

Each section will be coordinated by a single Core Council. The Core Councils will be led by the DNS Lords.

Each DNS Council will be allied together in unbreakable bonds. In order to be admitted into a DNS Council you must read and accept the terms of the DNS. A breach in any of these terms will result in a warning. A second breach of terms and you will be requested to leave. Failure to comply will result in forced removal.

The Terms:

1. No DNS Council member is to declare war on another DNS Council member under any circumstance.
2. No DNS Speaker or DNS Executive Speaker is to declare war on another DNS Council.
3. No Pacifist Council member is to use any form of spy attack with a hostility level above ‘Normal’ on any other player.
4. No Pacifist Council member is to privateer or blockade any other player.
5. No DNS Council member is to give out classified information regarding the DNS Council Organization to other councils.
6. The DNS Council Organization will not tolerate multi-account users, if caught you will be reported and most likely deleted.
7. The DNS Council members will only vote for the specified council speaker. The player that you should be voting for will be posted in the council forum.
8. It is requested, though not compulsory that you inform us before requesting admittance to other councils. We then know that you have not been killed or are attempting to backstab us.
9. DNS Executive Speakers and DNS Speakers are not to fuse any councils together without first consulting a DNS Lord.
10. Each member is to follow any command of a high level priority sent to them by a higher rank. All high level priority orders will be marked:
***HIGH LEVEL PRIORITY*** 
Any other type of command is non compulsory; however it is strongly advised that you follow it unless it is unreasonable. An example of a high level priority command would be to attack a specific player/council.

TO ALL PLAYERS OF ARCHSPACE
The DNS Councils are bound together by the Declaration of Unity and by the Galactic Agreement of Supreme Alliance.

THE DNS COUNCIL ORGANIZATION DECLARATION OF ULTIMATE UNITY
All DNS Councils are to be in eternal alliance with one another. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCE is a leader of a DNS Council to break an alliance, doing so will result in the council and ALL its members being sent into immediate exile.
All DNS War-Lords Councils may go to war with whoever they wish and any other council may declare war on a DNS War-Lords Council as they wish.
All DNS Beginners Training and DNS Advanced Training councils may go to war with whoever they wish. Any extensive raping of a DNS training council by other councils will result in a very nice request to stop. Refusal may result in the use of GASA.
DNS Pacifist councils will not go to war unless their speakers are instructed to by a DNS Lord. This will only happen when GASA is being put into practice. No other council may declare war on a DNS Pacifist council, if a council does than GASA will be put into practice.

GALACTIC AGREEMENT of SUPREME ALLIANCE (GASA)
This is the agreement that, if a council declares war or attacks a DNS Pacifist council, or an unjustified attack on a DNS Training council is executed, it shall be considered a deadly attack on all the DNS Councils. This shall result in all DNS councils within attack range of the target council declaring total war and attacking the target council, regardless of what section the DNS Councils come from.

Could all who wish to be part of the DNS please post on this thread. I would like all the Lords and Executives to make yourselves known here as well please.
