			  	once upon a time there was a council known as the great penis council, the only good player was the leader though but he was better than almost all of AS, so the council was the best council in the game<br />
<br />
but mutany was afoot and the other players ganged up on him taking him out once and for all<br />
<br />
the great penis council faded leaving only wannabes like egad and the koreans, but it was still a great day in AS history, some say a myth, but i saw it with my own two eyes the tragic downfall of the penis council<br />

			  	I hate the spammage of Santa...<br />
<br />
back to topic, the question is how you define &quot;best&quot;. In terms of domination and skills Targoid Empire (TE) was with no doubt the best council ever existed in Archspace. <br />

			  	Personally I don't think that HC fit into the top 3. With the exception of 'maybe' 1-2 resets, HC has always been overshadowed by another council. Many believe/d that HC's rise to fame and mega-size in 2001 was mostly due to its insider/special diplomatic relationship with EGAD. Without that alliance, HC would have had great doing as well as they did in 2001, as their ability to recruit so many players and fill close to 2 council slots was due to the security the council was afforded by the EGAD alliance. Further without the relationship, they would not have had some of EGAD's members move over (e.g. LordZolan, Paradox7 etc), whom ended up pretty significant members in HC. Also, in the one major set where HC did well in 2001 (the final season that year) it should be noted that in that season, a small council of about 6-8 players called Fremen attacked HC, dropped them over 4million fleet power (which was over half of the total fleet power of their two councils combined) and raped hundreds of planets - and a day later the Archspace Database had errors and rolled back 4-5 days to before any of this had occured. <br />
<br />
In 2002, HC became seen as more of a self-sufficient group. It finished Rank 2 in the first set, though still overshadowed by AZG. In the 2nd set, they were initially a major component of the war big TE war against AZG.. and fought strong alongside TE and GC's GDL, but in the end they just lost their momentum and any contribution to that war. If you look at the Hall Of Fame at http://avn.beheadedstraw.net/hof/ you'll see how far down <br />
<br />
Aside from that, I think the top 3 candidates are EGAD/Azguard/TargoidEmpire. In terms of revolutionizing the way early game warfare was conducted, AZG gets credit for 2001. I remember working with AZG/Fremen guys at the begining of seasons in small councils. We'd use different names and build up hidden waiting for EGAD/HC councils to be set up, at which point we'd declare and start waging war. Council hopping, independence declarations etc, followed. EGAD was the council that dominated the first season ever, and a considerable period of the second season, so they were established and well organized, and the only way to war them was through this 'guerilla warfare' style early game tactics. <br />
For late 2002 and 2003, I believe TE gets credit for their standard - get AMM faster than almost anyone, mass produce ships, and own everyone tactic - which worked over and over again.. <br />
2004 saw Koreans arise with their counter to this tactic (which infact was the way they had been playing on their server always). Being the only way to beat the koreans early game, TE adapted this and found it the most successful method to counter the Koreans. And now Koreans gone, whenever TE guys form a group, their early game tactics appear to be levels above anything the other competitive councils can produce.  <br />
<br />
In terms of internal organization, AZG comes nowhere near the other 2. TE and EGAD are likely the most well organized councils ever. It's hard to judge which does it better, though, if endurance through time is any indication, then TE prevails by far. EGAD and TE had very intricate forums. Both used MIRC consistently, both had very organized, active, informative and at times formal forums, which aided organization a great deal. Forums, if used incorrectly are a scourge to a council, as they waste time and just irritate people. However, if implemented well, they're a great asset. EGAD had regular votes on accepting new members, topics on ingame policy, on tactics, strategies, new developments in the game. Similarly, TE had contact lists, references to guides written by various players, tech routes, discussions on the results of armour/weapon testing, diplomatic planning, updates on lists characters we felt may belong to enemies, topics regarding community news (what councils were forming next set, who was joining, what alliances were being made, etc), even past rankings (most of the final ranks listed on the hall of fame, were taken from records on TE forums). Also during the begining of seasons, we'd have lists of players and their chosen character names and races; posts about who had a chance of getting speaker of their spawn council; threads identifying the roles players would attempt to undertake during the first few days of the set. (e.g. independence tech targeters, AMM/mass ships, mass commies, xesperado techer, non-specific backup) There were also security measures in place - members who had either left the council or not signed in for a certain duration, would be changed to a special inactive usergroup and have to negotiate with forum admins before having their forum rights returned.  <br />
<br />
In terms of player skill.. well, TE owned all but one season in 2003 (where the koreans came and took the top). If you look at the Hall of Fame for 2004 - The rank 1 council 'HOLYSHITNINJAS' had its success because 4 TE players (each who was in the top 6 fleet power) broke off from Holiday Camp and decided to help form the council. HOLYSHITNINJA's survived and grew over the next week and more, because these 4 players were able to initially fleet 1000s of doomstars and pass them around as allied defense. Season 2 was a messy one with Koreans returning with a plethora of multies, and the set was cancelled. Season 3 Koreans took over. Season 4 TE slaughtered everyone. Season 5, Koreans beat TE, and some cheats were allegedly used - TE retired, Koreans eventually disbanded. Season 6, TE returns and walks over everyone, without any challenge except for 2-3 koreans who tried to prevent it at the start. Season 7, many TE members are too lazy to play because of a lack of competition - 12 TE guys though, form a group without a name - referred to by the rest of the AS community as 'ex-TE' - and with just 12 players they take over and dominate the game once again. Archspace server has database errors, and server is reset. Season 8 - Darkness Falls, housing a significant number of TE players (6 or 7 - almost half its membership) forms and takes top. Season 9, a last minute chat by 3 TE members ends up in a muck-around reunion of ex-core-TE players, who decide to play as a group and see if there is any significant competition. - just over 30hrs into the set, the ex-TE group under the name of Last Samurai, have taken the top and have fleet power equal to multiple times that of rank 2. Last Samurai ends up disbanding, seeing as there's no competition, and the game is boring with one group totally dominating. <br />
<br />
Where AZG fell and came up again with a membership of new players who could hardly measure upto the ankle of their old elite members, EGAD took less time to fall, but atleast maintained their style and class as a Legendary council. TE however, which was founded in the same season as AZG (TE's 2 strongest members actually joined AZG when it came up - as they were personal friends with the members), and being only one season younger than EGAD, continues to return and prove a higher level of gaming. <br />
<br />
People say TE stole members from other councils, especially HC. However, this has occured with everyone. As I pointed out earlier, LordZolan and Paradox7 joined HC from EGAD. EGAD destroyed Krimson and stole some of their top members. It also got member/s from DEM (eg. XE-Trask) and recruited the whole of Cthulu Children (e.g. DancerOnce etc). AZG took in DEM (Occultus, Xe-trask, Gumpus) and RoT (Windspast, Trigon, Dejavu, Drexion etc), as well as TE guys..<br />
<br />
So... TE for #1.. EGAD and AZG can battle for 2nd and 3rd.<br />

			  	wow... we got an essay from nightly there...<br />
<br />
IMO, the small councils that endure against beatings from huge, well organised councils that have so many advantages are the real best councils, as without them most councils would have no one to prey on<p><br>________________________<br />

the only council that has truly dominated after archspace became cheat free is Targoid Empire.<br />

			  	I haven't been playing for the last 1, 2, 3, or something resets, buuttt...<br />
<br />
TE in the old days was, frankly, unimpressive. I still haven't forgiven Maxtor and his cronies for using the crash dooms then hitting the empire, resulting in one entire reset gone. I've heard stories about recent resets, but I haven't seen them first hand. I don't remember too much of EGAD, I think I joined during their decline, but the ex-EGAD players I've seen in action are all quite good. <br />
<br />
In terms of activity, I think Azguard would probably take the cake, since we were/are a bunch of people with absolutely no life. They were all pretty good in terms of skill too :P			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I don't think the peak of TE would've done so well in the midst of the EGAD/HC/Azg/NC wars.  At TE's peak, the elite members of Azg were bored and basically useless, and EGAD had diminished.  No doubt that TE and Azg were great councils in their peak, but I really think EGAD should take number one.<br />

<br />
Actually organization is actually what was AZG strongest suit.  We first used Icq when it was just the 10 or 12 of us in the first set, when we knocked EGAD down from number 1.  We moved on to mIRC later on, but at either time period we all worked together.  Thats how we beat councils that should have had us beaten easily, and even managed to take on several councils at once. As for who was the best, it really matters at which time you want to look at.  Before AZG there was EGAD, after AZG Im not sure who was the best since I wasnt here.  As for TE, they were good allies to AZG in every reset I can remember so while we we're always ahead of them in council ranking we never went head to head.  			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Stroud//Personally, I tell people that TE became 100x more aggressive and organized as of 2002. Not to talk down Kiria or Rayanth, but, imo, internal organization within TE could not compare to EGAD or AZG in 2001. I found it frustrating sometimes. <br />
<br />
However, the TE which re-emerged in 2002 was a very different group. If you think TE were decent/strong/good in 2001, we totally dwarfed that level of gaming in the following years. <br />
<br />
Exon// - I haven't really been in AZG secret/war channels to see how active AZG generally was. But TE too, had some extremely active characters. During the fiercest periods in some seasons, most of our 'core' players would get only 2-5hrs sleep a night.. Actually, it's a fact that earlier this year, when we found out that one of KR's best players (Xenoage) would play atleast the first 30hrs of each season without any sleep - the next reset Maxtor and I both called in sick to take a day off work; I played the first 27 hours without sleep, Maxtor played for 48+hrs. And I know of a few others who have done somewhat similar hours upon the commencement of a set, when it's crucial. That's just an example of how active we'd be at times. 			   <P align=right></P>

 i just wish this post can stay on top due to how much good information is posted. i havent played since the game first came out and i royally sucked. i always noticed my council would be going nowhere. but as posted the trick to being good to the best has proven to stay on the game(no life hehe im afriad to go to the gym too long away from the game) and great communication. this set we have only done alright due to the fact we all talk as much as possible. i just really want to say thanks to everyone posting and without trying probally helping some poeple like myself.<p><br>When you play with Fire you get hurt<br />

			  	I cannot remember the old Azguard, but from what I saw this year they didn't impress me at all (except in bitching around *cough* Drac *cough*).<br />
<br />
First set this year Azg was kinda fake with mostly former TE members, at least in the leading positions. <br />
Then they got terribly owned by Koreans 2 sets.<br />
After that they were a big part of the Legion-project, but again AVN and former TE were the reason why Koreans were taken down. <br />
At this point however, I saw extreme activity and good skills. Seeing that this council whatever it was called had huge internal conflicts leads me to the conclusion, it wasnt the real AzG again...<p><br>-----------------------------------<br />

@meth: no worries, all I wanted to say is that I doubt we ever saw the real Azguard this year or they just couldn't adapt to the new play style (fast, agressive early beginning).<p><br>-----------------------------------<br />

			  	I was still playing Diablo 1 back in October during Thanksgiving weekend, but that was mainly because I couldn't find my warcraft 3 CD..<br />
Even still, I never got tired of D1<br />
<br />
This is my first reset of Archspace, so I have a question, how come no one has said the Koreans were the best, since they seem to have been your only opposition for any of you, and for one council/group to take on 3 others, that sounds like quite the feat to me.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Keyan many people from Azg quit playing AS because archspace got slowed down sooo much after it was brought back with 10 min Turns. And it had 80%-200% attack limit, and Protection.   Everyone Loved the fast Begininngs and 5 min turns with no protection.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	have trigon ever played the game without cheating ?<br />
<br />
i welcome the old core azg and egad people back to the game, but im sorry to say, they will not be able to keep up the speed. i honestly have never seen any of the returning vets done anything impressive, nor does the stories that people talk about impress me at all.<br />
<br />
exonerate: you cant forgive max, but you can forgive what azg did ? double moral fool.<br />
<br />
methodus: i have never seen you do any good in the game exept talking crap, the same goes for drac.<br />
<br />
the only council that has truly dominated after the game became cheat free is Targoid Empire. Targoid Empire is the only council that has showed that with or without cheat they still kick ass.<br />
<br />
if people think im a big cock talker, then yes, i am a big cock talker. I will talk cock untill someone with skills shut my mouth. <br />

			  	Actually.. when we played as Solaris on the korean server it was quite awesome until the end of the season. Where a lot of bug use came into play. We had done pretty well against the Koreans in most instances, but right at the end of that season, when there was an agreement between top councils not to use a certain bug that had arisen, a couple of our members did end up abusing the bug (needless to say they were RoT members (or soon to be AZG in forthcoming sets)). In the end, Solaris didn't fair as well as we would have hoped in that last phase of warring in the last couple days, and the guys who as you put it 'beat down' on the koreans in those last couple days, actually abused a bug which would prevent losing battles, and then raped the Koreans as they slept. <br />
<br />
Also, the main Korean invasion of the English server which occurred about 2-3 months after we had played in the Korean server, consisted of a smaller proportion of Korean multies than we witnessed with the mass multies in second season this year. At the time of the first full invasion, a number of whole top10 Korean councils actually entered our server and worked together. So there were indeed a lot of players. The downfall of the Korean Alliance in that season, was almost completely attributed to the abuse of bugs by AZG players (The instant 180 doom creation bug). This has been admitted to me by AZG members on a couple occasions. So, really, when the Korean's were finally brought down by TE/AZG, on the night of their Soccer WorldCup Semi-Final defeat, it wasn't a deserved victory. <br />
<br />
hmm.. Keyan, I believe the Korean groups, having come from a number of councils could be called AVE (if u're referring to 2nd season 2002). Also, FreePlanet (which was one of their council names on kr server i believe), Moonlight and Rakisis (did i spell that right?). Rakisis and Moonlight both appeared in 2003 on our server, and by many was feared as being much more deadly than the Moonlight group. They were more aggressive, fast paced, more active, and had knowledge of some bugs. Actually, some anti-korean devoted councils managed to do reasonably well against Moonlight (Charlie was their main speaker back then), whereas noone stood a chance against Rakisis, except maybe TE, who were on par with them that season, and forced many of them to fluff past 21.477million power, which at the time was bugged due to integer roll over in the code, and would not allow attacks to be made. <br />
<br />
Rakisis disbanded after that set, and the remainded joined Moonlight in 2004. 			   <P align=right></P>
