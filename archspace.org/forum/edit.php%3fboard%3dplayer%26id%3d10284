						  Message:<br><textarea name="msg"  cols="50" rows="20">Well guys, it's been a little while since I've been here, and I'd like to get this topic back to its rightful place on the top of the forum. So, without further ado, let me introduce, yet again, my roommate bitching post. (not to be confused with a hitching post.)

Hmmm, where to begin? Let's start on Saturday, where I last left you. Saturday was a BIG day for the smart people in the dorms. It was the National Merit Scholars recognition day at the OU football game. Anyhow, my roommate, sod that he is, was the only guy getting recognized with his fucking shirt tucked in. He looked like a little prick. Nice thing was, I didn't have to sit with his sorry ass. We got free tickets (or at least the ones who didn't have season tickets - you should've heard him bitching about that). (On a side note, he's talking with his family, with a sibling named &quot;Miracle&quot;. What the FUCK?!?!?!)
Anyhow, the football game sucked major ass, and prompted me to introduce my newest Carlin quote - &quot;Double Fuck Sports Fans!&quot; Anyhow, yet again, he took offense at it.

Fast-forward to Sunday (today). After church, (I don't go to the same one he goes to, THANK GOD!!), I got home about 2pm. He asked me about my thoughts on the words I was putting on my board. Evidently, we've been &quot;raised&quot; differently. OH MY GOD - he's bitching about the music at his church, because it had &quot;rhythm&quot;. Holy fucking shit, he's an ultra-conservative!

OK, um, now on to tonight, because I wasn't around for most of the day (of course I ignore his faggoty ass). I went to the student congress meeting (I made it in). Then, I went to my HCSA meeting (housing center student association). I got back around 11pm. When I walked in, after joking around with some of the guys on my hall, he asked if I wanted to eat with him sometime. What the hell? I said no, and he wanted to know why. Luckily, he's such a unpersonable ass, that he didn't know I was bullshitting him with my reason. Anyhow, then he went on to say that if I ever needed help, he was there. I've got two words for him - PRETENTIOUS COCKSUCKER!!!

I should transcribe some of his phone calls. Currently he's bitching about people staying up til midnight (again, what the hell!?). Then, he wants to be an RA - shit, I would leave the fucking dorms if he became my fucking RA.

Actually, here's a question for everyone: Should I try to get an RA position?

Well, I'm tired, and I can't stand listening to his fucking ass whine, so I'm gonna go watch some movie. Probably Hero - which is an amazingly good movie!</textarea><p></p>
