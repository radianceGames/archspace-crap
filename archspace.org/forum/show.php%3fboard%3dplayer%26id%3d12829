			  			1) In the next set, will images be added such that there won't be an animated banner saying &quot;No Image&quot; on almost every page?<br />
<br />
2) Can someone explain to me the point of designing ships? Being able to add 11 slots worth of Homing Black Holes, Eternium, and devices on a Doomstar with set engines and shiedling doesn't sound like much strategy to me. The techs you add to a ship don't affect how much it costs or how long it takes to build the ship; it seems that there's no resource management at all in designing ships, just sticking the best of whatever you have at the time onto the biggest ship you can afford to build. I say this not because I'm complaining at the game but because I once played a game similar to Archspace where designing ships involved both skill and resource management because the technologies you added would affect so many things and even had complicated synergy effects with each other. I remember working on ships for that game so often online and offonline that one of my teachers thought it was quantum physics work because of the Archspace-like vocabulary(e.g. &quot;tachyon projection&quot;, &quot;quantum synthesis&quot;, &quot;spatial strand&quot;). This doesn't happen for me in Archspace because it takes me no more than five minutes to design a Doomstar like everyone else's once I finish teching. Then again, maybe I'm just stupid and missing something here.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any answers.						<P align=right> </P>

			  	2) Yes, ship design may seem a little simplistic for advanced players. But there is a lot of variety actually, you just need to find out ;)<br />
<br />
Ok, design is mostly &quot;missile-based&quot;, i.e Fusion -&gt; Amm -&gt; Nova -&gt; HBH. <br />
<br />
DB, NRL, OOD kicks in a lot later and is only really   worthful in 20 vs 20 doom battles which are rare. But still ;)<br />
<br />
However, its really NOT about always build the biggest, that's probably the biggest mistake you can do. Esp in the beginning the smallest ships are the most powerful resource wise (400 missile GB beat 40 missile Frigs easily and so on). Of course, you need to find a good compromise between power level (fluff), the numbers you can fit on a fleet (max. 20 fleets) and a commander (max. 40).<br />
There is a lot of skill involved here.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	actually, NRL kicks HBH ass in almost any battle<br />
<br />
<br />
and most people don't do pure hbh as a pure hbh doom will die to pure DB dooms + some fluff ships to take the first hit.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	DT, luckily you are a good dev, but not such a good player ;)<br />
<br />
Beam/Projectile is only worthwhile in 20 vs 20 fleet battles *sigh* believe me...<br />
<br />
and a good player should go pure HBH/DB when you want to maximise the effect of your commies (detection, Ballistic experts etc).			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Well, projectile and beam weapons have their value thoughout the game if used well. You never know when your projectile/beam backup fleets will save your ass in combat, generally being after all HBH has fired off and both side(s) are waiting to fire again. Especially true if both sides take considerable damage, as neither really has a significant advantage over the other. Keep in mind that Projectile/Beam do more considerably more damage than missiles over time, and if used well against opponents, can be used to compensate for the lack of fire power and/or technology. I did fine using pure DB dreads 2 sets ago for a couple of days while I waited to get HBH. When I finally did get broken though, I took a decent number of dooms down with me. ;p<br />
<br />
When you produce ships slowly, some people build mixed designs so that they can more effectively gain the bonuses of having both DB and HBH, and not be screwed if they lose all of a certain type, etc. Also not bad if your aim with that design is a more defensive one, and you aim for strong shields or higher/stronger hp/armor. Up to individual players really. Different things work for different people. Generally though, yeah, pure missile is a fav thing to do, and works quite well. Try it late game though, and you're asking for an ass-kicking. ;p Unless you have a massssive advantage, and quite literally shoot all or almost all your HBH BEFORE the enemy gets a shot off. Though, as we saw, remaining Xeru NRL dooms can easilly cut through the enemy's dooms. ;p Which makes NRL a very powerful comeback weapon that can easilly win the battle for you. PSL will be stronger next set as well.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Only? Certainly you don't mean Only. What if you got 20 DB dooms vs 40 HBH dooms, and you put up 7 one ship cruiser fleets. Is DB not worthwile then?<br />

Similary on equal grounds too it is useful.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Slowly being discovered as well that devices that were generally percieved as useless or near useless arn't. Some will gain potential value next set too.<br />
<br />
Well, Sylex, sure, designs end up largely being the same generally. But Archspace is more about battles than designs. Designs are merely a component of AS combat that allow you to customize your ships and give them names. Customization that potentially can change battles quite significantly as well. There is NO ultimate design. Such a thing does not exist. Circumstances of battle determine what good designs are. With races becoming more and more individualized, this is even more true. AS is vastely more complex than most people think.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	20 DB dooms vs 40 HBH dooms in a single battle is a very theoretical scenario, it would never happen to me, because I would never send 40 dooms in a battle, but 400 Dreads or 150 MF instead... much more efficient ;)<br />
<br />
However, you are talking about DB or NRL, but what about the other many many Beam/Projectile non-end game weapons? Imo, they suck and that I was referring to... <br />
