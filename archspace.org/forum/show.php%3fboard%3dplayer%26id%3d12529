			  			To Whom it May Concern (Including my council mates in The Spawn):<br />
<br />
I am quitting this game.<br />
<br />
After much time spent trying to get decent fleets, researching, trying to train my commies through missions, blockades, etc, just to see them killed, I have hit my limit.<br />
<br />
This game is probably one of the least friendly to new players I have ever seen.  There is an immence amount of information to read through and people who misinform you as to how to play the game.  There is almost no documentation to determine what you ought to be doing, just tons of text of explanations of issues that don't really matter.  How should any noob realize that weakers weapons don't matter?  How many times have I seen someone try to prove through the math of the numbers that many smaller ships ought to be able to beat one big one.  Of course, it's not true, but people want to believe it.  <br />
<br />
It is pretty simple, really.  Start at the beginning of the set.  Research very quickly till you can have HBH/DB with Eternium/WoK.  Then leach off of smaller players, trying to avoid the attention of those larger than yourself.  If you're big enough, you don't have to worry.  <br />
<br />
But if you're small, or new, it's nearly impossible to determine how this all should work.  More than that, it's nearly impossible to get a decent defense up, as once you're big enough to be building fleets of dooms, all of your commanders are always killed by people twice your size.<br />
<br />
Lest you all think I am some blabbering idiot who didn't take enough time to learn the game, I did manage to reach the top 50 in rankings before I quit (with only fleets of dooms, no fluffing).  I did figure out the researching bit, and I got some good planets (and managed to hold on to quite a few of the R/UR's).  I just am sick of trying (over and over again) to get a decent fleet built up, only to see all my good commanders killed by some jerk who needed to get his level 19 up to a level 20.  <br />
<br />
<br />
People talk about wanting to expand the playing base.  This will never happen unless a number of things change:<br />
<br />
1) A more friendly player base.  This is key.  If you're not one of the vets, you're not welcome.  This will NEVER attract new players.<br />
<br />
2) Better bottom-feeding rules.  If noobs realize that they'll never have a chance to have a full fleet of 40 dooms, they'll quit before they even realize how to play.<br />
<br />
3) A better explanation of the game.  Yeah, there's the guide, but I think that most people will agree that most of the guide is either fluff or crap.  The good parts are either buried or not written (otherwise how would the good players stay on top?).  And is the most recent guide even the one linked to on the main page?  <br />
<br />
4) A generally more complex game.  Right now, it's pretty simple, a race to HBH dooms.  The first one there pretty much wins.  If you get lucky and get some HUR's along the way (and don't get them raped by someone else), you'll land in a good spot.  Then, you'll be able to bottom feed off of everyone else, raping those smaller than you.  You'll be unbeatable.  And no thinking was involved.  Right now, the only way to be good at this game is to be online constantly, and to play without any respect of everyone else.  If more playing strategies were viable, more people would play.  <br />
<br />
<br />
But alas, it does not seem that these changes will ever be implemented (just look at the thread complaining about 10 min turns, which would have made the game at least a little more accessable).  <br />
<br />
Go ahead, flame me now, call me stupid, call me a noob.  Whatever.  I'm done with this game...it's not worth it any more.  Too much spite, too little thinking.<br />
<br />
AM will die without changes, and I don't want to be a part of it's sinking ship.						<P align=right> </P>

			  	Sorry you feel that way, but as someone who was noob only like 6 months ago, i can say that it isn't that hard to figure out this game. As you go along you find new milestones, and new ones, and new ones again. Before this set, i would build up, ,and get knocked down, but it was always fun, because each time i would get closer and closer to being near the top. Now that I am, i find that the middle was just as good, if not better, as the top has almost no action.<br />
<br />
     I agree that the game needs to be more accesable* to noobs, and that it is hard for someone who isn't often online, but that it is impossible. Thats it, and no, incase your wondering, im not dissing you, or flaming you, just stating my opinion. <br />

			  	I think the race to HBH abd that player wins is horribly wrong. Naru was kicking everyones ass this set and then got killed off quick. And im sure RedJack wasnt the first with HBH but hes kicking everyones ass, and i imagine he didnt use these &quot;horribly unfair&quot; things you are talking about to get to the top. Of course i'll let him defend himself.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Well said, GDukin, actually. I very much agree with several of your points.<br />
<br />
The player base is filled with assholes, and lowbie AS is hell, put simply. Players die constantly. Such should not be the case.<br />
<br />
The manual, however, is actaully quite good though. What it does not go over is strategies and such that vary quite a bit player to player. The thing that keeps the vets on top generally is their experiance, knowledge, activity, and coordination with the other players in their council. Honestly though, as Dr.Jekyl pointed out, it's really not much fun to be the one on top. Sure, you can mindlessly kill the empire. That's sure fun.<br />
<br />
The first player to HBH means very little actually, or alot of players would play Xesperados and Tecanoid. There is actually more strategy than you believe too. Simply having more doomstars doesn't mean you will win a battle. Hit a well known &quot;vet&quot; at 2/3s your size. Generally you will take a good amount of damage IF you win. First to top, especially with the new rules, doesn't mean you will keep the top spot. Naru fell, did she not? Dark Empire fell, did they not? And others fell as well. AS is complex, as you say. It is more complex than the majority of it's players realize as well. I've slaughtered people double my power on numerous occasions. I've won battles or done exceedingly well in battles that most players would consider impossible to win. People underestimate what you are capable of in AS, and seldom experiment.<br />
<br />
I do think that AS needs to be much friendlier towards new players though. atm, yeah, I agree, it's terrible. It's horrendous for players starting mid-set especially. They get raped. Constantly. I discovered last set that most players don't even have full tech at week 4.<br />
<br />
People hitting people half their power for commander experiance is just gay. For planets, I can understand, but for experiance is just lame. The honor system was nerfed a bit too much imho. I have yet to suffer anything significantly impeding or obnoxious due to my generally 0 honor level.<br />
<br />
The devs are trying to work on ways to help with these problems. 'course, it doesn't help that many of the changes they propose are violently fought by many players (10 min turns). :p I think we should give 10 min turns a shot next set. It doesn't make huge differences overall, though, realistically. You can still lose all your fleets instantaniously, and your planets shortly afterwards. The same players that do well in 5 min turns still do just as well in 10 min turns. It's just more convienant for the less active players.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm done for now. :p<br />
<br />
AS may have problems, but it's fun, and I keep coming back to it regardless. I wonder if I'll ever be free of it's grasp by my own will.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	seeing how short the sets are, i'm thinking 10 min turns next set may be worth it.<br />
anyway, i agree with alot of your points, just fixing things isn't easy =/<br />
<br />
the top is very boring btw with such few players ;/<br />
<br />
oh, and the #4 point about a more complex game i kinda disagree with.<br />
<br />
i would extend to you the plea to please stay. things are understandable frustrating right now, but  we are working on them. if a little bit slowly right now, but that's mostly cause (sadly) no answers to our problems are just thrown at us. and every solution always has drawbacks that make them hard to decide if they're worth it!			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I got to agree with GDukin a bit here (I have been in the top 25) not sure if making the game more complex would help though. Complex games annoy me- there's always the &quot;how the hell did that happen?!&quot; factor.<br />
<br />
I just had a member of my council quit totally basically because of the same issues... the whole HBH Doom thing was what kept us down for most of the game, and just as we were starting to get the hang of it... well, we got bombed back into the stoneage by someone bigger. And how did we get into their range? Bombing someone else without HBH dooms back into the aforementioned age. I have never seen a fair, evenly matched fight in this game, throughout its incarnations- you either get totally destroyed in an hour or you're destroying someone totally in an hour.<br />
<br />
I've led councils in the top ten, and as I said been in the top 25, and it does come down to HBH Dooms, and thats it. And also, I am fed up with some powerful tool who wants to give his commanders more exp wiping out my entire defense via blockading. Either take blockading out, or make it so their fleets actually have to stay to blockade, making it an actually risky endevour (ie- the blockader will be reducing his defenses while his ships are blockading for a day or so).<br />
<br />
Ans while I'm at it, what the hell is the point of boosts to research from the techs you get last??? (eg- Human Ending Mk1 and University of Past, Present, and Future) It's a waste. Give these projects- or at least something else that gives research boost and take it off them- earlier!			   <P align=right></P>

			  	i come with a suggestion for noob like me myself...<br />
<br />
Under War Section<br />
Upper power player cannot attack the lower power player but lower player power can attack the upper power player.<br />
If the lower power player attack the upper power player then the upper power player can attack the lower power player.<br />
Itn't that fair for new player or noobs?<br />

			  	yeah good points!<br />
<br />
WAKE UP GUYS, AS is dying more or less.<br />
<br />
How many active players left, 200-300 ?<br />
<br />
The game is complex for starters, may be too much I dunno. The guide is supposed to help with that, but I didn't see it improved things enough yet.<br />
<br />
So, solutions:<br />
<br />
1. I hate to say, but AS needs a new server or rather new admin, I don't see Mindwarper really significantly cares about AS. He did a great job reviving AS but it's time to move on.<br />
<br />
2. Either increase tick time (8 or 10) next set and/or increase the research time, so we will hopefully see more early/mid tech battles. <br />
<br />
3. Balance. I can't say it often enough. A group of 10-15 hardcore gamers can easily rule the game once they got the top position (esp. first 48 hours) and nobody is able to catch up even if like 100 players ally up and chase them.<br />
Various reasons for that, first attackin with 2x time more power. You can set up a power border virtually, honour was supposed to balance that out a bit, but it didnt work.<br />
Also limiting council hopping didn't solve this issue and many other attempts.<br />
<br />
A) Introduce weapon travel time, it will hopefully      prevent the current situation where attackers can win minor to 0 losses all the time.<br />
It will hopefully enable more &quot;suicide runs&quot; which  were gone without commie milking.<br />
<br />
B) More difficult ideas, like Nighty's cluster  war suggestion or trying out a random round, i.e you can only jump council one time in the whole round.<br />
<br />
I also have a bunch of ideas how to help new players and advertise for new players but that's another topic.<br />
<br />
Flame away ;)<br />
<br />
P.S. the community is actually quite friendly, i have seen much worse!			   <P align=right></P>

			  	GDukin,<br />
<br />
We have enjoyed your company and comradeship at the Spawn and hope that you will reconsider and stay a while - or at least return next set, and try to build up together - if not with us - there are many other good councils that assist well with player training, who have even more experience and time than I do, like OOA. Who have assisted in building great players in the game.<br />
<br />
I apologise for my own limitations this set due to real life issues, and the inability to lend a bigger hand.<br />
<br />
In the end we are one (once big) community, and many will help explain the finer points, even many of those that have killed you.<br />
<br />
Don't give it up - the game is at it's worst, but with maybe some small changes - maybe a raping limit or something - dunno. I don't have any answers either.<br />

			  	I know this most likely belongs in the suggestions board... but I'll post my thoughts anyways.<br />
<br />
I agree with almost all of the above ideas, 10 or even 30 min turns would be nice.. time to get things done in between. AS has cause many a schoolmate to not do their hw cause they were worried about a &quot;major war&quot; in AS... and the longer research time would also be nice. maybe putting a cap on the highest power a person can have, or maybe making it way harder to get power later on.. like maybe reduce the amount you can get for everything by 5-10% each 10 or 20K. that 80%-200% range would be nice as well... makes it fairer for the lower levels, and anyone who complains should think about this... why should you have to worry about a person with less power being able to hit you? Also... to liven up some things... maybe a few pictures/avatars for ship types, etc.<br />
<br />
I know I've only played for 1 year... and don't know what it was like in the Mari days... but there do need to be some changes... I even quit mtself for 2 months. (btw... has Mind posted anything recently?)<br />
<br />
Anyways... that is all for now... tty'all later :).			   <P align=right></P>

			  	If u use 80% to 200% power, how the heck are u supposed to retaliate if someone below you is attacking you...sure u can wait til they r in ur range but u think people are dumb or something. they will just take enough of your crap and not get in your range. 50%-200% is fair both ways for the attacker and the other guy. 30 min turns will screw up the game so bad.... the sets will last years and years and everyone will quit after one council has got the stranglehold. 5 mins is fine... dun like the sound of 10 min tho. dont complain bout the game if ur tempted to play it, its ur own fault for not doing ur homework or wateva crap u got. other than little bits, the game is good and u gotta give the dudes credit for it. 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	blockade has been extensively abused. it practically defeats the purpose of having a power range in declaring wars between councils. for example, a way more powerful council can pretty much kill all the fleets of your target council by blockade and then some members simply declare independence, rape all the planets and rejoin their original council later.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	they should just increase the player honour consequences so that you can really tell the difference... changing the % just complicates the game majorly, and the honour system is kinda up anyway, just change it so like someone who does that loses loads of honour, and therefore actually disadvantages them, unlike the current honour system.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	All I was saying about the hw was that out of the the 500+ people playing about a year ago, only about 200-250 are playing now.. and I know of at least seven of those, all who left cause they didn't have enough time. Others I know have left because they can't keep online constantly enough to stay alive due to work. 30 mins would greatly help with this, as like in games such as Mech Crusaders, you don't need to be online all the time to get anywhere.. yet you can still do so if you wanted. Another suggestion.. more options of stuff to do between turns... but this would make things very complicated code-wise... and more activity from the mods and maintenance people. The past week I've had 20 'Server down' messages... and yes.. the 80-200 range I suggested was for blockades... sieges are fine the way they are I think.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	80-200% on blockade seems fair.<br />
<br />
and yes througout the whole year there were at least 2000-3000 individual players in AS. Some might have only checked in once and quit. <br />
<br />
But still ending up with 200-300 active players certainly underlines something is wrong with this wonderful game :(			   <P align=right></P>

			  	well i reckon the game gets boring when theres one or two dominating councils. theres nothing to play for and the set is practically in their bag. wen that happens so early in a set theres not much point in playing. also the game demands you to check very often cos u can be dead in like 20 mins of raping. the key is to get decent set times while making it so we dont have to be checking like 4 times a day to keep urself alive. 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	personnaly i would like to see the powerhouse ship getting 1. Harder to hold. I mean personnaly i think that doom and maybe all ship fater all but to a limmited amount should cost more on upkeep. It seem pretty too eazy now to hold tons of doom. Every body here who know me know i am a noob at this game and i am actually holding 200 +. Thats not big i know but when people start talking about having 1000 doom and even more i just can't think this should be possible. I mean those are so big that they shoud cost lot more to own.<br />
<br />
2 Making them flaws. Here i mean make other ship able to actually kill them. In reality, why does a rich country like the USA don't just make the powerfull aircraft carrier winch is i belive the most powerfull and costly ship they actually own. Well it's because it have major flaws. So why those doom need to be the first ever perfect ship who do all duty right and easily. The only thing why people are not building them in late game seem that it's because cruiser are better at raping cuz you can have more but they will make the frontline.<br />
<br />
On another point i think that making the shipsize influence the max ship a commander can hold in a fleet. I mean how com even a genius can manage all the info needed to issu order to 40 ship that are soo big they can house what? about 10k people maybe but they can issue similar order to more that 40 gunboat with 1 man crew????  hmm sound a bit wird dosen't it?<br />
<br />
yeah flame it and put comment plz<br />

			  	hmmm... I just had a thought... what about giving certain ships an edge over others... like say having a ship type of Shining Star or something being faster and having less time between attacks, yet it's weapons have a deduction on them.. wheras the doom could be slow, and have more power. and maybe another that could create illusions to confuse other ships and make them flee faster, yet has a weaker frame, and has a deduction for armour... would something along those lines work?<br />

			  	doom slower  how will it make the game better  the battle will last a couple turn longer cuz the doom need to reach the target then will fire it's crap load of HBH and the enemy will die as always  it's not a speed problem. Those ship will be flawles untill they cast too much to have a BIG amount of or they can be swarmed by more fleet/ships. But since we are limmited to 40 ship / fleet and 20 fleet / battle well we can't swarm them cuz people do 40 doom fleet. <br />
In reality 40 bownmen won't kill 40 Marines but 400 bowmen could possibly kill those 40 marines.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	hmmm.. true.. I'll try to use ratios to better explain my idea...<br />
<br />
doom: <br />
normal strength, yet fires at a rate of 1:1, and accuracy of 80%, average armour strength.<br />
<br />
shining star (for lack of better name atm): <br />
reduced by 10% strength, yet fires at rate of 3:1, with accuracy of 65%, 5% higher armour strength.<br />
<br />
Illusionary: <br />
average strength, rate of fire is 1:1, accuracy is 80%, armour is reduced by 15%, yet creates illusions that increase the chance of the enemy fleet fleeing by 30%.<br />
<br />
<br />
This kind of pattern could be used for all ship types, so that there are at least 3 variants of each level. 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	not suer but i think we should 1st use the ship class we already have before creating new one or more will be useless because some will find a way to unly use one or like right now  but adding you idea like fire rate, evasion, and accuracy odifier would be usefull for sure<br />

			  	I guess I might as well bring up my posts in the suggestion forum.<br />
<br />
LAUNCH TIME DELAY:<br />
How about adding some delay between you give an order for your fleets to attack and when they actually arrive at enemy planets? In conjunction to this, if you have fleets stationed in that planet, they will have a certain percentage to detect incoming enemy fleets according to their fleet/ship size. <br />
I think this makes sense since your attacking fleets usually take some turns to return and it opens a possibility for ally coordination (pre-emptive strike or counter). Also, the delay should depend on distance between two planets. This can be quite easily done by coding a bit of math since the planets already have their ID # attached. <br />
<br />
WEAPON/ABILITY:<br />
My solution to  this (HBH overpowered) would be introducing the idea of evasion. <br />
<br />
Maneuver (maybe interpretation as well), ship size and weapon range and speed will affect evasion.<br />
For example, chances to evade an attack = <br />
(maneuver * (1+interpretation/10) + shipsize penalty) * (1+ (range/speed)/100) %. <br />
To put it simple, range/speed acts as a modifier to evasion. <br />
<br />
I have also suggested in another post the use of interpretation - station/patrol fleets will have a certain probability to gain info of the incoming attack fleets. This of course needs to be implemented with a launch delay and detection gives a certain probability to actually detect any incoming fleets before you can interpret them.<br />
<br />
To inject yet more randomness in a battle, I would suggest the priority of attack does not only depend on detection difference but rather treat it as a dice. For example, +6 detection will be 6 rolls of dice type 6 and +5 will be 5X5. And of course, comparison between positive and negative values needs to be made before dice roll.<br />
<br />
I think evasion is a good idea because it introduces more randomness in the battle. While AR and DR calculates dmg, evasion gives you an opportunity to evade the round of attack. However, to offset the shipsize penalty of bigger ships, we can either add # of weapon bonus (larger ships carry greater number of weapons per slot and therefore makes a defender harder to evade. This might be hard to code, since I am not sure how dynamica the battle system is) or give larger ships armor bonus.<br />
<br />

			  	no problem  at least you got a good idea<br />
<br />
but i really think making fleet made of more ship if ship are of lower class would be usefull if you put enough to be about fair  i don't whant to make the doom useless but lower player would probably like to see they can kill some thing even if he can build doom as fast as the top player can			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Great the same issues i complainted about about a year ago still here...i told you AS woyld die, even in Mari Days we had more than 3000 players, then the Mind early days we had a lot of them but the vets abused their knowledge (hidden atm) and killed very noob in their range, then some changes were made, and things got the same crap, its sad to be a &quot;vet&quot; now since the ones that stood here all this time are the same that yelled at us (NOOBS) to shut the hell up and deal with the vets way...most of you are changing their way of thinking, but it could be too late, i really hope we find a way to get along better, the &quot;honor&quot; shouldnt be about stats or ranks, but about respect for individuals who are new to the game, when i started i loved the part where a good apology or asking nicely could end a war, but in the later days things got out of control.<br />
<br />
<br />
                           Yesus<br />
ill post some suggestions later im tired now <br />

			  	Yeah it was actually great because tha huge player base allowed you to be out of war for a week, and when you were ready u would charge, also it was very rude to actually kill the players, we would only take what we needed, but now that changed to ripp eberything apart just for a rich, the rich ultrarich hunt became too agresive, and thats cause when Mari/Gracia died, the player base was lowered to half, and the reset was 7 months long until Mind came to action, i wont say that it was easy, but diplomacy actually meant something, then with no cooldown policy, player base lowered even more, when that happened thing became even more agresive, so it comes down to this ....i heard the real player base is around 200-300, even if it is 600 that makes it very sad, and hard to play, i might try and play , but im sire ill get pissed soon, the good part is that if only vets play i will learn a lot of things.<br />

			  	Oh man... yeah i see there IS a serious problem... when people are asking to implement evasion something is sad :(. I was going to make a guide but before i finished a edead's guide came out and i thought that was fine, so I abanded mine, but now i see there are some really serious problems going on :( I might have to restart making it perhaps or someone else should. <br />
<br />
First of all, there IS evasion in the game dammit. Its been implemented since the game started. There are many factors that decide it, they each make small contribution but together they make a noted and proven impact. What you guys are confused about i think is Defence rate vs Damage Resistance since both of them are abbreviated as DR. Basically what you can do to make your ship more evasive is increase mobility, computer or armor Defence Rate  (ECM jammer, Enginnering Specialist) These factors can cause the HBH to miss and do no damage to you. However DB is hurt the most by this cause of inherntly low attack rate it already has.<br />
<br />
I thought these things were explained in the guide? Save for mobility of course.<br />
<br />
As for anyone saying that Pure HBH with uber detection is cheap and overpowered and that it destroys all strategy let me tell you this. I was able to attack someone using this strategy, they had 20 HBH fleets with high detection commies + 2 allied DB fleets. All the enemy HBH fleets fired first (and I do mean all) and yet I was still able to win the battle with a loss of 400 dooms, because the other player didn't even bother to have a proper balanced fleet, just went HBH crazy. There IS a lot of strategy inside the game, but you have to find it out for your self and learn it, and stop complaining about it, the lack of strategy is due to players not the game.<br />
<br />
Anyway yeah this game is quite complex for a noob to learn in one set though and master it unless he starts in an already developed council... making random councils idea would be fun, or perhaps just doing what MMORPGs are doing for massive PvP, divide things into realms/factions so that when you start you are already part of a team. People tend to help you better when you are part of the team, but honestly to discuss all strategy that this game has takes a lot of time.... and a lot of effort to learn too.<br />
<br />
But yeah those ideas are very radical though, so i dunno. Speed is the natural progression to evolve the game from here on out though. As suggestion forum suggests, Im all for speed :).<br />
<br />
As soon as DT codes it that is! 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	&quot;ok so we all agree there are some problems.<br />
<br />
i'd rather have good solutions =p&quot;<br />
<br />
Ohhh, but solutions are so much more complex and vastely more difficult to come up with. ;p<br />
<br />
aphyre is my in-game name, but all my BRs for the past week or so are from the empire. =p No battles like that this set either really, save for the beginning. I'm sure you can find such battles though. They're not entirely too rare, heh. I'm not like the only person who's ever won battles vs. people larger than myself in fleet power. =p<br />
<br />
Launch time kinda screws a heart component of AS, which is fast attacking, so no, that's not gonna happen. ;p<br />
<br />
Umm, lemme see. Yeah, evasion and accuracy is already implemented. =p<br />
<br />
Not sure where I stand on weapon speed yet. I still think AS is mostly fine as it is. Block range would be nice for stopping 2x things, but you should still be able to help out council mates and not have to siege a crappy planet to break someone while at war. Provided it was not in place while at war, perhaps. Though that makes running tactics much more effective, which is gay (declaring independence). People often fail to realize that EVERY change generally has negative effects as well that they fail to see as well.<br />
<br />
umm, yeah. Methinks I'll go take a nap. Since that's all I can call my normal amount of sleep these days.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Heya, suggestion for battles. Introduce friendly fire, if it's technologically possible. This'll prevent people from crowding up all their ships together without drastically reduced efficiency. <br />
<br />
The spreading out of fleets will <br />
<br />
a) mean that it is possible for many low-commie fleets to gang up on a high-commie fleet so they get a chance to fight, and <br />
<br />
b) will make possible the introduction of tactics which will give a new dimension of reality to the ship battles which are, imho, currently just slaughterfests at which ships are being thrown at one another with some concessions made for commie experience. At least we can have Nelsons winning battle by tactics and not just by commie experience and weight of numbers. We have a good graphical battle display, I suggest we use it.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	hmmm... after some major confusion.. I found another problem that the game could do with out...<br />
<br />
When a person dies... they supposedly get to keep their techs and ships that didn't die... why should this be? this would also make the top players closer to the others, as they cannot win every battle on the way there.. no-one can really. things should just reset, period, when you die. 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Yes DR which is influenced by mobility, ship size, computer, armor, devices etc. IS evasion. Ships avoid whole missiles and thus avoid taking damage. But if 40 missiles are fired, you are not supposed to evade 40 of them... you avoid some % thus you take less damage.<br />
<br />
Indeed the game is more complex than most people think. The original poster mentioned that it's all about building the biggest ships with HBH which is totally untrue. It is exactly the opposite, the key to early victory, the one that ensured the koreans and TE domination is actually using small ships. I assure you that I will beat the hell out of your 1 million PP worth of cruisers using 1 million PP worth of frigates. Moreover, pure HBH is stupid, unless you dominate and always have power advantage. <br />
<br />
Some adjustments has been already made to end-game weapons (PSL, OOD) to make them more competetive. Same goes for races (lots of Buckaneer love). But that's hardly important for the ultimate survival of the game.<br />
<br />
IMHO, AS would automatically fix itself if it had larger player base. Larger than any time this year.<br />
<br />
I think DOABLE things that are needed to attract new players are: <br />
<br />
- new forum. who cares if vets like being oldschool if it looks like 80-ties crap and scares off new people. come on, when you enter AS you have the impression than nothing changed for 5 years. and people outside laugh on AS for being a buggy korean game. Even if it stopped being so buggy, it has to look more decent to speak for itself.<br />
<br />
- new newbie guide (not advanced guide like the one I wrote, but updated one explaining the very basics)<br />
<br />
- better administration (news/reset annoucements on the main page but also on several gaming sites. every browser based game annouces resets on mpogd.com, but not AS. <br />
<br />
Next reset HAS to be annouced on AS page and mpogd.com and it HAS to be done a week before launch. <br />
<br />
Moreover, slower research, and... siege cooldown. YES. As much as many of you hate it, this is excellent measure to reduce the lethality of AS by great amount. Be it 5 mins attack/defense cooldown if you insisnt on 5 min. turns. Don't blame just the vets for being assholes. The whole game is lethal, some say it's even worse in mid and low councils than on the top.<br />

			  	*Agreed on most of these points*<br />
<br />
So who will talk to Mindwarper for the reset announcement? ;)<br />
<br />
A 5 min siege cooldown seems kinda cool.<br />
It gives time to rearrenge your defences,etc..<br />
<br />
The no cooldown makes it easy for everybody to die in a matter of seconds/minutes.<br />
<br />
Losing techs when you die, umm, with the above statement, it pisses people off to die a couple times in a short period of time and have to research techs again. I've seen a couple players quit because of that.<br />
<br />
Idea - Unsiegeable Homeworlds (players don't die, they keep their buildings on homeplanet, so always have some kind of prod even if you're defleeted/raped down to 1 planet etc.., you can continue to build up again in a lesser way instead of stopping completely). You can still blockade the homeplanet of people so they can't hide their fleets(if they had any). Ship Upkeep will get them someday. ;)<br />
<br />
I really think it'd help to keep our players and the new players that will join eventually.<br />
<br />
Post your PROs and CONs in the SUGGESTION FORUM. I made a thread named Unkillable. Post there.  I wanna hear your opinions.<br />
<br />
And Yes, we badly needs a new Forum layout, with one isn't attractive at all and it looks old.<br />

			  	I'm not forum active that's all. I'm on irc though, not hard to find me if you have a similar timezone (e.g. not korean).<br />
<br />
I don't know if you understood me well, but I'm not coding anything much anymore, just little things here and there. DT edead and zbyte do the deving, so you guys have to come with something most of you agree on that is not good for vets and bad for noobs, but good for as.<br />
<br />
Once that's done, we devs will talk about it and implement it somehow.<br />
<br />
But, it's really important that you come with some ideas before the end of the set since after the next reset there will not be many updates cause I'll be gone.<br />
<br />
Once you come up with something good, talk to the devs not me, they are in charge of gameplay updates.<br />
<br />
In case you don't know what server: <br />
irc.archspace.org port 6666.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

			  	the game is heading the in right direction....<br />
<br />
set last longer cos the empire is harder (and sets should be long, otherwise it gets boring re-building every few weeks), you do stand more of a chancewhen you start out because there are often good things on the black market, and with the introduction of nahadoom ray HBH is not necessary the the best weapon.<br />
also, with the new formation setting thing, (and hopefully new battle reports soon) the general look of things will be better. I stopped playing for a few months and just came back and was suprised to see the change.<br />
<br />
just give it time			   <P align=right></P>

			  	If I may add my 2cents again:<br />
<br />
I totally agree with what edead wrote.<br />
<br />
In general, it would be wise not to reset before some of those significant changes are done.<br />
<br />
In terms of attracting/keeping new and old players I also strongly suggest to design a really kick-ass looking new start page. <br />
Unfortunenatly, I'm not skilled enough in webpage-design myself otherwise I would give it a try, but I'm pretty sure there are some decent websigners out there, they just need to be asked ;)<br />
<br />
Moreover, I would like to see a #help channel on AS IRC server, where new players can come to ask questions. I have seen it in another game and it's really cool! It may get some more folks on IRC as well which is also REALLY important!!!<br />

			  	Edead is fully correct. Those changes would help the balance of the game shift back to how it should. All the shit i hate but, all the necessary shit.<br />

			  	Hmm I would like to point out something that is not being addressed. If we are to add the cooldown only the people that have free time can benifit. Once again not everyone has the time to stay in the game and keep sieging, If we are going to add a cooldown, would it should be at least 1 attack/3 minutes or 2 attacks/for a turn of 8 minutes whichever is easier to implement. A lot of people don't have the time to login and play and it won't change the fact that you can still get killed overnight, however, now it will take forever a lot longer for you to rebuild. Granted there are good sides to cooldown, but what about the fact that redjack becomes unkillable right now? It would take around 4-5 days to take him down under the new rules, assuming no resistance. Another solution can be perhaps the cooldown should only start applying after the player is down to 20th-30th planets? Newbies don't generally get more then that anyway, but this would most definately screw things up at higher strengths, it fortifies the top.  So before major major problems arise in next set I urge to look at it once again, and think of these side effects. Not necessarily mine, but perhaps something else...			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Shadowman, you make a good point about Redjack being &quot;unkillable&quot;. However, that is only if the siege cooldown time was implemented now. If everyone were to be subjected to the cooldown time at the beginning of the set, it would be difficult to acquire as many planets as Redjack has now. <br />
<br />
Players managed with the siege cooldown time during Mari, why not now?<br />
<br />
I know that some players found that only being able to take one planet total from their target per turn (and hence others not being able to siege for a planet) was irritating. <br />
<br />
So my suggestion is: <br />
one planet per attacker per turn from the same target.<br />
<br />
This would help balance the fact that killing someone like Redjack (with over 1k planets) will not take as long. <br />
