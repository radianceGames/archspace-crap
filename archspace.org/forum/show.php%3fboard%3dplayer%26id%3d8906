			  			You all know it, but let's gather some facts.<br />
<br />
An organised group of 15-30 skilled players can rule this game (500-800 other players) in an absolute superior way if it wins the first 24 hours of a set. This group can only be taken down if it splits up due to internal problems.<br />
<br />
The new changes made things even worse even though there was a good intention. <br />
<br />
No milking means you have to spend a lot of production (wasting ships) to get lvl20 commies, but that's no problem for superior No1 council in contrast to smaller councils that want to catch up. So the gap widens.<br />
Increase of random blockades will keep players always down low until they are too frustrated and quit.<br />
Decrease of UR means that it takes much longer to build up a full doom armada and as long as there is a decent player with 2x dooms power attacking you you will always lose and it takes ages to build up again due to lower resources.<br />
<br />
So all in all, to get on top should be easier than staying there. And right now, it's the other way round.<br />
<br />
P.S. new honour system won't solve the core problem, IMO.						<P align=right> </P>

			  	Exactly.  And I semi remember the comment a while ago that TE made about coordinating this whole take-over in the beginning over a period of weeks.  Was I the only one that thought that was just a LITTLE over the top?  I mean..  holy crap..  I'm as addicting to this game as the next person, but is there a time where you take the game, a free online game, just a bit too seriously?  But that aside, it really is becoming redundant (see former post).  The entire site, not a single council has made any significant dent in TE.  None.  I go through the TE battle reports and see nothing but defender wins.  Even the guy that blockaded me (name withheld) with a really well formed formation and 100+ dooms stands no chance against a whole bunch of members with full armadas.  No amount of coordination will compensate for pure power.  Even if every single member of OOA, SS, MERC, whoever else, being everyone sans TE was to mass coordinate against TE, we'd kill possibly 10, maybe half of TE.  I think I did that math someplace and I can bring the proof of it if you want, but it's literally not possible to gain on the lost ground.  We can just sit around and wait for TE to kill the empire.  I don't knnow what kind of system has to be implemented, but there are a TON of suggestions that I saw, and though implementing them ALL is impossible, it's still possible to siphor through all of them and get some real decent ideas to improve the gameplay.  Maybe if I have time later on, I'll organize my thoughts and have some more input on this.  Until then.. um..  congrats TE?  As they say on ATHF, from which I draw much inspiration, &quot;SUCK IT  SUCK IT DRY&quot;			   <P align=right></P>

			  	No offense to the rest of you guys, but we knew going in if you win the first 48 hours, you win... It has been that way for a long time, the changes did nothing to stop that.  If the koreans were playing this set, it may be them on top not TE... if any of the other councils coordinated in the first 48 hours like TE, then they would be on top.<br />
<br />
That being said, it is getting a bit boring.  I keep looking for someone to come in range so I can fight, but it isn't happening.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	[QUOTE]Exactly. And I semi remember the comment a while ago that TE made about coordinating this whole take-over in the beginning over a period of weeks. Was I the only one that thought that was just a LITTLE over the top? [/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Well, maybe it was a bit over the top but if TE hadn't done it koreans would have dominated again exactly like last set. <br />
<br />
IMO the problem with the game is, as Keyan said before, that the powerful councils will become even more powerful, while the weak councils stay weak. With the recent updates this has even be forced. That's why the beginning is so important. Once you are #1 you'll stay there till the end of the set. <br />
<br />
I think it would be better to give weak players benefits than to limit some things (like commie milking, planet production, fusion) for everyone.<br />
In Archspace you can fall very fast. Between being top 10 and being dead there often are just a couple of minutes. But it doesn't work the other way around. Rising in power is very difficult and often impossible due to the reasons everyone knows. <br />
In Order to make the game less frustrating there are only two possiblites (IMO). Either include some kind of protection if you've lost too much power or speed up the rebuilding process. Personally I don't like the idea of protection, because it's another limitation. Better give weak player production boosts while giving players with strong fleets production penalties. Give players the opportunity to get enough lvl 20 commanders in a short time no matter what power they have. This way there will be much more fleetbattles in the game. Especially new players will have no chance to learn the game, if they never get the chance to test designs, weapons, formations and commander abilites. The only way to learn this stuff is in fleet battles so ppl should have the opportunity to war often. <br />
<br />
Also the beginning of the reset is less important because when ppl can rebuild faster they can achieve much more with coordination later in game. This way it'll be challenging both, for the #1 council and for the other councils. Saying TE,koreans,AZG or whoever is ruining the gameplay always is the easiest conclusion. <br />
<br />
My 20 cent ;)<br />

			  	I really tried to avoid the name TE, cause it doesn't matter, as it was said before it could have been Koreans or any other organised and skilled force, like sets before this year.<br />
You can't blame a council to strive for No1 by all possible means the game provides.<br />
<br />
So, let's try to carry on this discussion on a neutral point of view.<br />
<br />
As Ziu said I also think it might be worth to think about some penalties the more powerful your empire becomes, something like &quot;corruption&quot; may be. <br />
Moreover, I think planet power needs to be increased.<br />
In any case, there's no point to bring down No1 council by Empire attacks or random destructive events. That wouldnt be good for the game either.<br />
I would rather like to see players to try bringing down No1 council through real fleet battles. <br />

			  	1) Decreased attack range would help, but not solve the problem.  I think that 80%/125% would be a good compromise between the number of targets available and being able to easily stomp your target into the ground.  Keep in mind that a tighter range makes allied fleets more influential.<br />
<br />
2) Actually the weaker planets are better for the game because the difference between a council that harvests all URs and a council that has only Normals isn't as bad as it was before.  This has been a great tool for leveling the playing field.  It does cut down on how quickly the dominant council builds up, but the lower councils build up the same and better with the new increase in poor and ultra poor planets.<br />
<br />
3) Blockading should be reserved for war.  This kind of an attack is necessary (attack ships but not gain planet), but not outside of war.  However, because a lot of information can be gained with a blockade (planet information, # of fleets, etc.) even if you cancel on the last screen sending your gunboat into sortie, it is necessary to have some kind of Recon mission take it's place so that method of gathering information is still available (fleets automatically sortie afterwards and never engage the enemy).  I'm not how much this would help the situation though.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	While I do agree that taking down the council is often very hard, it is by no means impossible...<br />
<br />
However, I do agree that some steps might be appropriate....<br />
<br />
I do not think that allowing milking or some other unfair advantage to weak players is the correct solution though.. In addition, making planets have more power will achieve the exact opposite of your objectives, since then the player's total power will be less affected by his ships, effectively allowing players with even MORE ships to hit players with even LESS ships then before...<br />
Instead, I propose this:<br />
<br />
* The primary objective is to make it harder on the top council to stay on top. as of now, once a council has achieved a certain power advantege over all other councils, the workload of staying in this advantage is severely lessened.<br />
<br />
* To achieve this goal, The empire needs to become more agressive - feeling threatened from strong players, It should ask for more and more money more and more often, the more powerfull someone becomes... In addition to money, It should ask players to attack other players it doesnt like.<br />
<br />
* Of course, if the empire doesnt like someone, and no one agrees to attack him, it will do do the dirty work itself, attacking him, and if winning, keeping his planets...<br />
<br />
* Because of the new agressiveness of the empire, its initiale planets should be reduced to a couple  hundreds.. the reason is so that resets can be shorter and dont prolonge for a huge time after everyone has finished researching... the resets will not be very short though, because after all, the empire can be the agressor...<br />
<br />
* this should be imposed on everyone, but of course, it will hurt more to whoever is very powerfull - as in real life - even with all the technological advances, spaceships should decay with time. its Illogical that a ship can be used for very long without maintenance, and eventually, it should get scrapped... <br />
 * what I propose is that even ships that werent damaged must be repaired after some time/X battles (whatever comes first), with the time between maintenances shortening as the ship ages, shortening faster as the ship participates in battles, and even faster when it gets damaged.<br />
 * as the ship ages it cannot stay as efficient as it was, when it just came off the production line... and when a ship gets damaged in battle, no matter the amount of repair done, there is alwasys some permenant damage...<br />
 * when the ship has decay reaches critical levels, the ship must be either scrapped, or risk exploding in battlefield, wrecking havoc on all nearby ships, or at home, destroying other ships, and maybe damaging or destroying planets on the way... maybe a ship should just have a small chance to explode every turn, and as the ship ages and gets damaged, the % should increase...<br />
<br />
* In conjunction with the aging ships, its also illogical that commanders live forever... <br />
 * I propose that commanders should also age, they abilities first increasing as they become wiser etc, and then decrasing as they become old and lose their quick thinking etc.. of course, they should eventually die...<br />
 * In addition, its not probable that If a commander does nothing for a long time, hell stay just as fit as he were... to stay in top shape, the commanders need to train, and also have battles, although not as frequent as trining... the frequency should increase with the experiance of the commander, lvl 20 commanders being an elite of elite, and having to train almost 24/7 and battle constantly to not lose their edge... if a commander doesnt train/go to battle for a certain duration, there should be some exp. decay... after all, lvl 20 it the top of the top of the elite commanders, and how many top elite can you have? :D<br />
<br />
I think the most important changes are the ship and commander decay in that order, which will ensure that being extra super huge is extremely hard :P to make matters more interesting, its possible to do the changes with the empire (btw, I was told that the empire IS aggressive now (ive been away from the game for a while...))<br />
<br />
a very radical change that could be tried is making no limit for how high up can be researched,  (i.e. having 'special' research after the normal one is finished, and you ascended :D) and for the power of the weapons and other ship utilities which can be manufactured... this way, weak people can concentrate on research, and beat the top guys using superior technology...<br />
<br />
This last change just came to me, so I wrote it in case anyone finds it an interesting proposition... I havent thought it over much, and it might turn out that it doesnt achieve what I was looking for, so more consideration is needed here...			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I have a bit of a different opinion about the blockade... I dont know if it should be cancelled outside of a war - I need to consider that for a while - but I think that both blockage and siege screens provide you with too much free information - Its understandable that the planet's size, and most attributes could be seen even from clusters away, but stuff like its resources, or wether it has hostile aliens, violent microbes, volcanos etc.. might be a little too much...<br />
this info should be gathered by spying. Maybe this way, spying modifiers will be a bit more usefull important, other then for stealing techs, and it will be harder to hunt for URs if you have a bad spying ability (and in general, becuase it costs money to spy, youre not always successfull, etc..)<br />
this will also help against one giant council overtaking the game, since if good planets are hard to find, top councils wont have that huge an advantage as now... and security levels would also mean something after the tech race is over...<br />
<br />
actually, thinking about it, this is probably the easiest feature to implement, (not show all info on siege/block screen) and it will have an impact almost as strong as the other measures I suggested...			   <P align=right></P>

<br />
Hmm, I read your ideas, but I don't think they'll help the game. You still only think of liminting stuff or making the empire stronger. At the end the weak councils will suffer only more. If you make the empire too strong the #1 council will simply adapt and stay low in power. If the secure border against the empire e.g. is 100k all top players will stay below 100k, with the result that all other players have to stay below 50k. <br />
You have to realize, that the #1 councils are #1, because they have the ability to adapt to changes very quickly. <br />
As I said before, the only good thing you can do is to speed up the rebuilding process of weak players.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	yeah, Empire taking out No1 council REALLY sucks. Admins then also could delete No1 council.<br />
<br />
It has to be decided in fleet battles, real council vs council battles. That's what the game is about and not fighting against a dumb Empire made by the devs.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Ziu - The limiting factor on the Empire can be put differently, for example, the top 15 councils will be targeted. It does not neccessary have to attack someone just because of the power that 1 council process. That way, the top council must constantly build up in order to counter the aggressiveness of the Empire, and then the weaker concils can strive to take them down in a coalition of some sort.<br />
<br />
As for the decaying ships, that is actually a pretty good idea. As the ship ages, its abilities will be decreased over time. But this, however, will take days, hell, even weeks to implement into the system, so the suggestion must be considered very by the mods.<br />
<br />
For blockading, look at examples from WWI, WWII, the Berlin Blockade and the Cuban Missle Crisis. Isn't blockading something to limit the supply of the enemy? So Nova's suggestion, making blockade a war act, would stand, but destroying the entire fleet of the enemy would be unlikely because the aggressor's fleet would not be engaged unless the defender's fleet strength is greater than the aggressor's. The Recon idea is a pretty good one too, making it neccessary to use the spy option.<br />

			  	Ziu!<br />
<br />
thanks for the response!<br />
<br />
however, I feel you misunderstood my ideas - for instance, with the empire aggressiveness, it wont only be turned against anyone who has X more power then the averege... it will be turned on to anyone that the empire dislikes enough, and players it feels threatened by - aka. top players... say anyone above 180% of the averege player power...<br />
this will make the top guys fight two fronts - so they will be too busy defending from the empire to just go bash anyone who gets close, allowing the midweight guys more leeway in attacking top guys, etc..<br />
<br />
also, you didnt address any of my other points... - ship decay will make it very hard to climb above a certain power, and commander decay will make sure no one has too many high level commanders, or too many of them at all...<br />
<br />
the decay might actually lower the top power, but this is actually a good thing - because it WILL make weak players climb faster... right now, the top players have over 1M, where id guess the averege power is about 20k... with 50k guys being all in the top 100... if you bring the top players closer to the rest of the pack, it will be much easier to wear them down, and let me promise you that top councils will change much faster then they do now... <br />
<br />
If you disable seeing of of the planet's features,  (especially its resources..) IT will be much harder to go planet hunting, especially during the beginning of the game when spying is very unadvanced, and people have little money to spend on it... this will ensure a much longer time before a dominant council emerges, and it will be much less dominant then now, allowing for much more room for competition... it will also crate more diversity in the chosen, and top races, since spying abilities will be much more important...<br />
<br />
my last idea lets the bottom guys acquire superior weapons and thus enabling them to defeat the top guys.. this one best works together with option no. 1 (about the empire...)... but there is a lot to consider here (for instance, might not the top guys get even better waepons etc, and become truly invincible?) and this is the hardest to implement by far, I think, so im just throwing thoughts with this :D			   <P align=right></P>

			  	keyan, you also did not understand my intentions, but it took me long to write the previous message and you responded before I did...<br />
<br />
Neo_Blietzkrieg, thanks for the feedback!<br />
<br />
you came closer with what I meant about the empire :D<br />
but I want it to attack on a player by player basis, not on council basis...<br />
this could be an area where court rank came into play - for instance, being a baron could let someone rise somewhat higher then ususal, without risk of the empire's wrath...<br />
<br />
by the way, a little thing that bothered me was that  you can keep bribing the magistrate even after he is dead.. I think that maybe after he is dead, he should be replaced by a stronger one, and his planets should be taken from the empire pool... this will just make a bit more sense, but not affect gameplay too much...<br />
<br />
thinking of it, I have an idea incorporating some of the opinions I saw to this matter - first of all, about the option not to defend, its just a modification that needs to be done in the defense plan system, to make it more advanced (i think he defense plan system needs a bit of a makeover) - there should be an option not to defend your planets... so you can choose that say for sieges coming coming from anyone bigger then 120% your power, you wont defend with fleets, etc... (but of course, all your fleets will defend your home planet, no matter what you choose :P) however, If a leader doesnt defend his people against attacks, he cant be too good of a leader, so the player's honor should drop on any attack that he chose not to defend... :D<br />
<br />
I also think that maybe blockading should be limited, not totally (only for war) but for helping allies' wars as well... this seems logical to me... and it will finally put some weight into council alliances...			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I think the ship decay is a good idea. Why not for the permanent damage, just reduce the max hp of the ship? Sooner or later it will succumb to attacks due to it's decreased hp.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	It seems almost no point in playing archspace anymore. It is entirely TE-dominated. Entire player top ten is TE, and so is 4 out of top ten councils.There is no way you can win, because TE is just too strong.I can even guess what the ending of this set would be like.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Ok, come short comments:<br />
<br />
@Neo Blitzkrieg<br />
<br />
Empire targets top 15 councils<br />
--&gt; #1 council will split in 15+ subs with 2 players in each.<br />
<br />
Decaying Ships<br />
--&gt; Players with high production can easily replace those ships with new ones. Once you are #1 it isn't difficult to build a new doomstar armada every 1-2 days.<br />
<br />
Decaying Commanders<br />
--&gt; They can be replaced very easy aswell. When you are #1 you can train many lvl20 commanders every day.<br />
<br />
Blockading only when you are at war<br />
--&gt; #1 council will simply stay in permanent war with everyone.<br />
<br />
@Shwouchk<br />
<br />
Use empire to hit players with much power<br />
--&gt; Unless they give the empire commanders uber-stats it won't be a problem to defend. Against the empire and most players you can win even full doomstar battles without losses.<br />
And if you give the empire uber-stats, well, if you bring down the #1 council the empire will destroy the next #1 council so at the end ppl will try to avoid being ranked high. Don't think that would be fun.<br />
<br />
Decay for Ships/Commies<br />
--&gt; See above<br />
<br />
Disable seeing planet features<br />
--&gt; #1 council simply takes all planets from a player and destroys the crap. <br />
<br />
Superior techs possible<br />
--&gt; #1 council will have much more RP each turn than the other councils. This will only widen the gap.<br />
<br />
Except the empire thing none of the proposes will hurt the megapowers and like Keyan already said, it would be ashame for the game if the empire is used to kill the best players because the other players can't do it. <br />

			  	One thing that pissed me off is that we talked about it earlier Keyan, and we agreed that the changes have nothing to do with it. Again you blame the development for shit - you know well that it was EXACTLY THE SAME earlier ie. the first korean reset. If one council wanted to own whole AS it could do that. Last reset was different only beacuse the Koreans have LET us build up. Sorry ;			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Oh, and as for the changes... the game is under constant development... more changes will come obviously but no, we won't bring back abusable features like milking and unrestricted fusion. Those are steps to make the game playable, one of the many steps but they have to be taken as well. Well I speak for myself but I'm certain other devs will agree.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Some things that work in other games that may help here.<br />
<br />
Limit Alliances to 4 players.  (Of course this won't limit blocks of alliances working together, but will limit those that can directly support each other to 4)<br />
Limit Blockades to war status only.  Blockading fleets must stay on blockaded planet for a specified time to enforce the blockade.<br />
Create a Scout mission for ships.<br />
Increase travel time for missions outside own cluster and have it incremental for each cluster.  ie, if you are in Yehl, missions in Yehl take the standard time, missions to Bagvarti take standard time +2, missions to Nun take standard time +4 and so on.<br />
Add a request intervention option in Empire Dipl that would allow council leaders in good standing to request the empire attack higher ranked councils who declared on them, with the same chance of success as request mediation. 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I like Ziu's suggestion of giving a bigger boost to the players rebuilding, and slowing down the build rates of the top players. That might help set up a sort of an equilibrium between all the players, making it so that the majority would stay in a set power range fighting on a pretty much even ground with each other, where your skill in ship combat comes in handy.<br />
<br />
One way to do it is to drastially increase the ship upkeep and the cost of PP per MP. There are already limits created in the game, on how much you can produce, of course those limits are a bit disproportionate as they take weeks to reach and are hard to build up to. Ie someone can rebuild very quickly to reach 20 turn dooms, but to reach 1 turn doom would take ages and you can't do it without good back up.<br />
Perhaps also make it impossible/improbable to have a full doom armada, giving all the ships some usefulness in combat.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts			   <P align=right></P>

			  	As a new player to THIS game I will give my opinion. TE is ruining the game for me (thats said). However no one in the above or this post is saying they are or have done anything illegal to get to the top spot (congrats to you). They took full advantage of the game as it is currently played. So here is my opinion of a few changes:<br />
<br />
1) NO ALLIED FLEET- This I will explain later<br />
<br />
2) No in council war ever. (Planet passing to the top member)<br />
<br />
3) All wars between 2 council would concluded after X hours and could not be restarted between the same councils for X time.<br />
<br />
4) Let the defensive player have the option of defending a blockade by a much superior player in power. The fleets station on planets defend against raid and privateering and seiges.<br />
<br />
5) Stop multi's, stop multi's, stop multi's<br />
<br />
6) Since I know someone is thinking get your sister council to seige and blockade you with crap fleet to train commies. Each ATTACK you lose after the first one to the same player (within a certain time frame) would take away from your commies confidence and abilities unless you attacked with X percent their power.<br />
<br />
7) If you declare independence from a council after the council have started a war you can never go back. For 48 hours you can still be attacked as if you were a member of the council you left.<br />
<br />
8) 2 request per set to join different council. After that you are there for the remainer of the set.<br />
<br />
There are others but this is it for now. IF you think everything is crazy that is and opinion also. But do take a close look at my reasoning for no allied fleet.<br />
<br />
Now to explain the NO ALLIED FLEET. With no allied fleet to protect you it become difficult for member of the super councils to break away and rape other councils. This will stop a player with 500k in power from breaking away from their council with 3 players with 60K and attacking a council with 12 player and each player is averaging 60K in power. With no allied fleet to support them it is like 3 against 12. <br />
<br />
Reasoning: In our war with (cough) we managed to kill a high ranking player (with the empires help). Within 8 hours that player was back with his foot in our rears and at approximately 1.3mil in power and 79 planets. With no allied fleet that player would not survive a come back during combat. For this player to survive you would have call a truce. In a war ONLY ONLY ONLY the superior council can support weaker members with allied fleet.<br />
<br />
Coding nightmare maybe but it is my opinion. I wonder how many names I will be called for this one? Excuse all spelling error.<br />

			  	It's always been a single council dominating the game, or two coalitions of large councils - in Archspace, the people with the most powerful fleets always win. <br />
<br />
A couple possible ideas to reduce the phenomena of single-council dominance:<br />
1. Reduce attack ranges. I've been saying 75%-133% for a long time, but many people don't like the idea because it means less planets they can steal.<br />
2. More aggressive councils. In AS, the aggressive councils always win - its the reason the Koreans, Azguard, TE, etc dominates. They build up a good start, and nobody can catch up with them. Problem is, if players aren't aggressive, then there's not much else we can do to rectify that. Perhaps some way of giving attackers a bonus so that people will try to defend less.<br />
3. Stop mega-councils. I realize this is probably a pretty unpopular thing to say, but dominating the entire game with only one single council will be much harder than doing it with many more councils and players.<br />
4. At the beginning of the reset, let players choose their council, but then don't let them apply to other councils. At the end of each round, let them stay with their council or find a new one. This allows you to be with your friends, but stops the hop-rape-jump routine.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	edead - of course the game is under constant change - I have not for one second, thought otherwise... :D<br />
needless to say that abusable features should not be incorporated into the game... the feedback I was looking for was for my ideas, to make them better so that I will post them on the suggestions board in a complete state (that is if i generally see people agree to them)...<br />
<br />
keyan - same thing edead said, plus, if you dont think these changes can work, drop a few suggestions of your own... but dont ask for exploitable features please :D<br />
<br />
ziu - what I see you do is just dismiss everything suggested... not only do you not give any other suggestions of what to do instead, but you put no thought or effort whatsoever into you dismissals...<br />
<br />
&quot;Empire targets top 15 councils<br />
--&gt; #1 council will split in 15+ subs with 2 players in each.&quot;<br />
<br />
small councils can only go to war with small councils - and if the players will be strong, they wont be able to find councils of their size with players of their size... and besides, if the top council can do it, so can everyone - and since the top council's players are the strongest, they will still be on top and get attacked... only now they will only be able to give 2 total support fleets to each other...<br />
<br />
&quot;Decaying Ships<br />
--&gt; Players with high production can easily replace those ships with new ones. Once you are #1 it isn't difficult to build a new doomstar armada every 1-2 days.&quot;<br />
<br />
thats right, only you forgot one thing - the more ships the player builds and lets decay, the more chance of some of them exploding and destroying other fleets, etc... and the decayed fleets also dont fight as well... anyway, the point is, that unlike now where players can have and upkeep thousands of doomstars, even hundreds will be hard to keep for long... and as the numbers increase, part of the ships is constantly going to be in maintenance... enabling smaller players to more easily bite through...<br />
<br />
combined with the empire giving them a hard time, staying on top wont be picnic...<br />
<br />
&quot;Decaying Commanders<br />
--&gt; They can be replaced very easy aswell. When you are #1 you can train many lvl20 commanders every day.&quot;<br />
<br />
werent you the one who kept whining that without milking, its next to impossible to get good commanders now? do you think those 2m players on top have many target to blockade? because I dont... this already breaks a part of your story - either the top guys wont have many good commanders because of no one to attack, or they will be closer in power to the rest, meaning my theory has worked, but enabling them to get good commanders... anyway, by blockading its very hard to get more then 1-2 lvl 20's in a day, (and thats assuming you always win and have no losses...) unless most of the battles are very large scale, meaning the enemy has a lot of firepower, meaning part of my goals were met :D win-win :P<br />
<br />
&quot;Blockading only when you are at war<br />
--&gt; #1 council will simply stay in permanent war with everyone.&quot;<br />
its kinda hard to stay in permenant war with everyone, unless they have similar council power - otherwise they cant declare... and if council powers are close, my goal is achieved :D<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Use empire to hit players with much power<br />
--&gt; Unless they give the empire commanders uber-stats it won't be a problem to defend. Against the empire and most players you can win even full doomstar battles without losses.<br />
And if you give the empire uber-stats, well, if you bring down the #1 council the empire will destroy the next #1 council so at the end ppl will try to avoid being ranked high. Don't think that would be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
first of all, people will always try to rank high..<br />
second, the empire will not kill the top council or even the top players, but it will hurt them...<br />
with the ship decay and commander decay it will not be so easy to withstand an empire's hit with no consequences... also remember that to defend from the empire, one needs fleets at home - so top players wont be able to smash their whole armadas at the people they attack now - they would have to keep around half at home to defend from the empire, allowing the weak guys to decently defend...<br />
<br />
&quot;Disable seeing planet features<br />
--&gt; #1 council simply takes all planets from a player and destroys the crap. &quot;<br />
<br />
by also taking the crap, the players bloat their power without increasing capacity that much - so they would have to do the killing rounds slowly, in 12 hour rounds, allowing for MUCH more competition in the way... I wont get too much into this now, but If you consider top councils' strategies, they all focus on UR hunting... by not showing them everything right away, their whole strategy collapses...<br />
<br />
ziu, I dont really undertand what you are trying to achieve... do you want to log on about once a day for about an hour and take down the top council every time? no baby! of course you have to work for it... but right now, to take down a top council, you must be way better then them - in a totally different league... with the improvements, really good players will be able to take down really good players...<br />
<br />
all in all, my suggestions are not meant to destroy the guy on top, and even with the changes its very likely that councils would be able to hold out for a week and more if very good, but overall staying on top will be harder, and the top council will be more in reach for destruction by the the midweight guy... It does not mean, however that he will get to be on top, because the top will always be reserved for the more coordinating, more thoughtful, skillfull, and with the more time on their hands :D<br />

Reply : assuming your suggestion is taken into developement, how difficult it is for people to keep track of their ships in each fleets? Simply form fleet with date of productions and people will be able to keep track. When the ships is decayed, simply scrap them. <br />

<br />
Reply : What Ziu is trying to say is that, Milking is still possible, but, it's only limited to the #1 council. After all, how many council can send Doomstars to suicide just to lvl up 1 single commander experiences?<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have doubts, you are welcome to fluff up to 'test' the 2M guy up there yourself.. :)<br />
<br />
and ps : when Ziu said top-council can have plenties of lvl 20 been produced on a daily basis, he really meant it.<br />

From what I had gathered, alot of your constructive suggestions are really based on pure theory. You are assuming alot of stuff in here, and, these will be misleading to others that had just joined the game. <br />
<br />
Maybe you could answer some of my questions as posted below for a better understanding of the top-council conditions/status?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. How many turns does it takes for the current top-council members on average to produce 1 Doomstar?<br />
<br />
2. How many Level 20 commanders does the current top-council members have in average?<br />
<br />
3. What is the maximum cap of PPs? ( I'm assuming that you know that there's in fact a maximum amount of PP u can save )<br />
<br />
4. How many councils are currently at war with the current top council?<br />
<br />
5. How many members does the current top-council has in total?<br />
<br />
6. How do you judge the skillsets of a top-council members? By how many planets he has? By how much power he has? or?<br />
<br />

			  	yeah, Maxtor knows what he's talking about. <br />
<br />
The reason why I didnt give suggestions is because I wanted to analyse the core problem first. <br />
Suggestions can be given on the according board.<br />
First step to solve a problem is to know whats wrong, isnt it?<br />
<br />
But if you don't mind, some short comments. <br />
<br />
1. No allied fleets (or increase receiver in power) worth thinking about.<br />
<br />
2. Change council only once per reset also worth thinking about though it might interfere with AS's real time character cause it will slow down the game a lot.<br />

			  	i think we should make expeditions be finished insanely fast so its easy for everyone to get lots of ultra richs, and its harder for the top councils since anything past their 20'th or so planets get waste<br />

o and make it so you cant expedition for planets after your 20th or so one			   <P align=right></P>

<br />
Is that really wise? think about it like this.. your in a council, you just lost all your fleets and you just jumped to a council which you believed was safe but 2 turns later, an even more powerful council declares on you... what are you going to do? You cant declare indi because that would register as a change in council number and you cant request admission into another			   <P align=right></P>

			  	first of all, keyan:<br />
<br />
about sending allied fleets - if anything its better to disable allied fleets then it is to make sending them change powers, since that can be abused... (for instance, a big guy sending fleets to a small guy, enabling both to attack someone in the middle...)<br />
<br />
about changing councils - that could be nice.<br />
<br />
neo_blitzkrieg:<br />
<br />
hehehe :D youre welcome :P<br />
<br />
maxtor:<br />
<br />
most of your replies to my suggestions were nothing more then dismissals, or ridicule...<br />
and when there is a comment that approaches being meaningfull, you make it with totally no connection with my other suggestions... If you have something smart you want to share with the rest, please write a paragraph, not a line, explaining your point of view... simply stating stating your opinion, is not enough...<br />
<br />
for instance, I can just say &quot;maxtor, youre an arrogant ass&quot; and it would be just an insult thrown in the air...<br />
wheres if I say &quot;maxtor, youre an arrogant ass, because instead of answering the issues and explaining your point of view, you focused on ridiculing me and trying to play out the uber vet&quot;<br />
<br />
see the difference?<br />
<br />
anyway...<br />
<br />
it wouldnt and shouldnt be difficult to keep track of decaying fleets... this is not the intent of the decay rules... the intent was quicken the circulation of ships, making them last 2-4 days at most, with no batles, and maybe a day or two with them... this will limit the top amount of ships one can have, and make the number directly proportional to his production...<br />
<br />
another consequence of this if it were to be implemented is that ships besides doomstars will actually have value now, because it will be hard to stack ships...<br />
<br />
as for the doom milking, im not even sure what you meant - since I dont milk, and I have only just rejoined after a long period of not playing, I didnt take the time yet to familiarize myself with some of mind's restrictions (milking, fusions..) maybe this is a chance for you to enlighten me - what were the exact restricitions mind placed in the milking area?<br />
<br />
about the permenant war, the SS and OOA are hardly 'everyone'<br />
and if you stay at war with everyone, everyone can attack you, so theres the down side there...<br />
<br />
<br />
define high? high is the first place, baby. I do not define I high in terms of the amount of power, since that would be stupid... I define high in terms or relative power... 2M is high compared to 100k... 100k is high compared to 20k... and 20k is high for 3k... whats your point? and with fleet decay, to get to 50++m power (in dooms), they'd need to be making at least about 20 dooms a turn... assuming high commerce, people would need to have around a thousand HUR with MC planets, or much much more crappy ones... when that happens, theres usually a reset, since the empire provides the planets... and thats also assuming that the number of empire planets isnt cut...<br />
<br />
<br />
I should check more battle reports? well, maybe youre right... this was the main strategy around the time I was leaving... so youre saying it changed? what is the new strategy?<br />
oh, and btw, looking at BRs wont reveal me the type of the planet, nor wether the attacker jumped in/out/fused etc...<br />
<br />
my suggestions are based on pure theory? where did you get this idea? are you the top As scientist now? and if my suggestions are no good, you are more then welcome to provide your own...<br />
<br />
and the questions? nice try to showoff... Ill answer them anyway...<br />
<br />
1. well, thats kinda hard to say since I dont know exactly how many of you are there, etc.. but judging from top #10 rankings, id say the averege is around 2/turn<br />
2. I dont know, and I couldnt care less... just a random guess: ~500<br />
3. wow, another try at smartassedness... last time I checked, it was 2b<br />
4. I dont know or could care less... I assume by referring to council, you actually mean the 10 councils with TE somewhere in the name ;P I think a better suiting name would be a 'player coalition'<br />
5. right now, you cant... or at least I cant... a tiny bit can be learned from his past brs... I could also come close to judging his potential if I see how he playes in the beginning of the set, or by putting him against an real threat in a stressfull situation - kinda like most human qualities are tested...<br />
<br />
by the way, another idea I forgot to post - when the empire asks someone to attack someone else, it could also offer reinforcement fleets that dont decay for a certain duration, etc...<br />

			  	WD - the one change in council is there so you can get into the same council as your friends, not so you can run from battle...<br />
<br />
speaking of which, it has been brought up, and I do think its wise to somehow limit the ability of a player to plunge into battle right after death...<br />
<br />
its a bit illogical that someone can be killed, then ressurected with fleets and pp in the pool, maybe get a couple of allied fleets, and go right away into killing the opposition (or the other extreme, get killed again, and again, and again, and again etc... :P)<br />
I think there should be a 'cooldown' time between someone's ressurection, and the time he can participate or be the subject of violent acts... maybe 6 hours?			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Some things I think would help:<br />
<br />
Tighten the attack range. Nova's was good.<br />
<br />
When a player loses x amount of power from seiges or blockades he cant be targeted for a certain number of hours. Differing amounts for each. <br />
<br />
The antibot stuff is good. Makes playing more fair. <br />
<br />
Make loss of honor have a penalty-a real penalty.<br />
<br />
No in-council seiging of planets. Make every player get off their duff and get there own.<br />
<br />
No allied fleets. If you cant swim in the ocean then stay in your wading pool.<br />
<br />
I dont think loss of planet stats would help. Someone would just keep seiging to find the one they wanted.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a stronger empire but to be honest I want to do my own fighting. After all this is a war game. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the idea of the ships or commanders degrading over time is helpful. At this point in my power range I dont have lots of pp or the ability to build ships quickly. At higher power the person can make several dooms a turn. This could hurt the person in the lower power range who takes say maybe 3 turns for one doom. I think the lower power person would be the one ending up more vulnerable. Same problem w/commanders. Whos sitting around in a lower power range with a boat load of commanders at level 20?<br />
<br />
Limit the amount of time a council can be at war and then make it so long before they can declare again. <br />
<br />
Limit the amount of council hopping a person can do. 2 I think would be to few because things change quickly in archspace. <br />
<br />
Make it easier to get level 20 commanders. The new changes with the mission is good but it still needs more beefing up. Make a special mission that may cost more and take longer but gives much more experience.<br />
<br />
Thats my 2 cents			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Maybe make decaying fleets for players over 250k power or something. Anything lower and you likely don't have enough planets/production to be able tor egenerate dooms in enoguh time, whereas if you are a 500ker or whatnot you can usually produce 200 a day or more, compared to a 200ker who can maybe make 50 per day<br />

			  	I now see a sore subject is allied fleet. Allied fleets are the main reason the top ranked players are from the same council. As long as a 60k player can be supported by a 500k player in a war that 60k player is immune from successfull attacks. (example in earlier post) And the only council who can use allied fleets would be the stronger attacking council. The weaker one's players will need all their fleet to try and survive. Thus the weaker council becomes a feeder council for the top one. One or two player pass along their planets and destroy their fleet, the council declares war and take the rich and urich planets from the weak. With no allied fleet this would be very difficult because the lower ranked player from the top council would probably lose. (Even with help from a sister council who had a player in that attack range.)<br />
<br />
Before you someone state the weak council players need to learn to play the game look at the earlier post where it is admitted the beginning 24-48 hours determine the ruling council. Not the most skilled or the vets. Other councils have skilled players but looking at the ranking you would not know it.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	@shwouchk<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to show off, but you just let me realise how &quot;experience&quot; you are to the game. You think that my comments on some of the things you said has no connection, simply because you can't see the connection. <br />
<br />
<br />
You never milked, nor understand how milking system works, and you don't know what's been impose to limit the old milking system, and yet, here you are, trying to discuss &amp; comments on milking system.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the decay system, assuming you set a decay rules of 2 days, if top council players are producing 2 DS a turn, u do the maths, and let me know if they gonna feel very hurt by this decay system. It hurts the smaller guy more than the bigger guy, because the smaller guy can never accumulate enough ships to defend against a full assault from the top-council members.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the perm war, TE warred almost each &amp; every council in the beginning, if TE didn't wanted to give truce to any council, that war relationship can stay there forever. Just how difficult it is to be in perm war? Locke posted a very good post on this topic previously, check out : <br />
<br />
https://as.mlsecurity.com/forum/show.php?id=8132<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for definition of high, I don't need 50M power, I don't need 1M power, all I need to do, is to stay at 2x your power. When you said to get to 50M power by Doomstars, ie: building 20 Doomstars a turn,  it makes me wonder, how long had you been playing with the game???<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason why I'd asked you to check BR, is not to check planet types, nor attacker jumping in &amp; out/fused etc. I asked you to check BR for tactics to overcome the blind planet status during war suggestions. Locke post earlier should give you some hints on this as well.<br />
<br />
You might also want to check out some of the players recent fleet battle against the top-council and study how often does the top-council members lost ships in a full/half armada assault.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, for the summary of my questions.<br />
<br />
1. Yea, you are correct, so how do the normal average players compete with this kind of productions?? By setting a decay system, the top-council will always remain at top, simply because they can our-produced the little one.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. 500 lvl 20?? u must be kidding me. check out the dev release notes at :<br />
<br />
https://as.mlsecurity.com/forum/show.php?id=7537<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Well, at least u know there's a limit on Max PP, but, do you know how frequent it is for the top-council members to reach 2B PP cap? Do you understand the advantages of having more PP than others? No one out-bid the top-council in Black Market, top-council can constantly invest in everything, making them building DS faster, develop planets faster, tech faster ( in the earlier stage ).<br />
<br />
<br />
4. You don't know, or couldn't care less. That's the problem. You don't know the strength of the top council, you don't know the weakness of the little council, and apparently you couldn't care less to check them out or understand it, and yet, you are giving some nice ideas, which imo, will only make the little council become weaker than b4. <br />
<br />
Top council has like 30 players, when the smaller council want to rise in power, they gotta go through the ladder of power. You gotta defleet/kill the top-council players 1 by 1 from the ranking page. When you hit the lowest top-council players, chances are, there's another 10 more top-council players in your range. If you didn't get yourself defleeted by hitting the top-council players ( if you are skilled &amp; good enough ), then, you'll find yourself facing 10++ of other top-council players alone.<br />
<br />
Problem with this ladder game is that, the top-council members that got defleeted, can simply fluff up to 2x the power of #1 player on ranking page, and you can't touch him anymore. However, you can't run away from retaliations. <br />
<br />
<br />
5. that's the problem. You don't know the skilsets of the top-council players, and you assume that mass number of players can win against them. Why do you think that the top-council members have no fear on declaring war against 3/4 of the AS councils with only 5 players in it? It's simply because they understand their own advantages and enemy's weaknesses.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for further suggestions to tweak empire, etc, this is a war game, the fun in it is to play/war between council vs council. Do you prefer to win a battle on your own, of you prefer to ask the empire for help to win a battle on your behalf?<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, I'm not top As scientist, but I happened to be the leader of Targoid Empire, that's why I know my own council's strength against other councils. My suggestion to you before you suggest any more ideas, is to try to understand the strength &amp; weakness of the top-council, middle-ranked councils, and the little councils. <br />

			  	again all your comments were focused on inflating your own ego and trying to show me in a bad light... nevertheless, Ill answer some of them...<br />
<br />
<br />
no, there actually is no connection - most of your comments were/are in the context of that single suggestion...<br />
<br />
I have never milked, but I do understand how the milking system worked. I do not understand how it works now, because I do not know what restrictions were placed - If I were to know, I could tell you how you milk these days.<br />
<br />
they are gonna feel hurt by this system...  If they produce 2 dooms a turn, they could at max, hold 1100 dooms... while this is about the amount they currently are holding, with the decay rules a big part of those dooms will be in repair all the time... also, the decay is continuous, so the actual power of the dooms will be equal to much less &quot;perfect&quot; dooms... for instance, one would have 1100 dooms total, equaling around the power of 800 dooms, with around 300 in repairs... assuming the ones in repairs are somewhat decayed, the actual firepower of the dooms will be around 600 dooms... now thats already less then a full armada of 40 dooms/fleet... also, assuming the empire attacks the stronger players with non-decayed dooms, they would need to keep a minimum of 400 dooms at home, for protection against the empire... (and not lossless battles as now) that would leave about 400 dooms for attacks on lower people, with those dooms having 300 dooms' worth of firepower... seems to me it would be just a bit harder to be on top... I also forgot to mention that with these numbers of dooms, i think top councils would also think twice before wasting dooms on milking...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been playing the game from set 1. with the decay rules, you would be able to have 2-3 days' worth of dooms - lets calculate - 50m power/2200 power per doom ~= 23k dooms... to have that many dooms, youd need to build them in the 2-3 days, so lets say 36 hours 23k dooms/36 hours/12 turns per hour = 52 dooms per turn... my previous calculations were based on 4 days :D<br />
so 52 dooms per turn? looks like youd need around 4 times the planets I originally said... thats including upkeep costs, and assuming youre not in a negative budget...<br />
<br />
normal averege players will not compete with this kind of production... the abnormal good players, will realise that dreads, mofos, etc... have suddnely become valubale and important to the game, unlike today, where you can remove all designs besides cruisers, gunboats, and dooms a couple of weeks after the game started, and now one would notice...<br />
<br />
seen the topic... ok, 150? I just threw a random number - in short, a lot...<br />
<br />
see? now youre neing an arrogant ass again... I dont know about top council members, but before I left, I reached the cap fairly often... lol - you seem to imply that only the top council can invest in everything all the time... I rejoined 3 days ago, and after the first night I had no pp shortages... I dont recall being in the top council... <br />
<br />
wow, now you really hit the arrogant fool profile... you seem to be making quite a bit of assumptions there... for one thing, what makes you think I dont even have a ballpark figure for the number of player in the top council? for another, what makes you think im in a small council? last time I checked, I had 34 other people, just in my main council... for yet another, what makes you think that most higher councils dont have 20+ members spread around the game, themselves? and what makes you think that I dont know this theory? or that I would be fool enough to go and try to kill the whole top council by myself (or anyone for that matter...), and not have 10 more people there with me? and last but not least, you seem to imply that the player would be playing 24/7... unless you share accounts, thats not so possible... do you have something you want to tell the rest of us?<br />
<br />
whoa! yet enem more assumptions! what makes you think that I dont know the skills of TE players? you seemed to assume that if  Im unable to know how skilled he is by his current stats, I generally dont know how skilled he is? you also seem to assume that I know much less then you do about strategies and tactics, and the art of war, in general... with so many assumptions (and wrong ones, too), its wonder your council even came on top... I guess youre lucky 90% of the players this set are noobs...<br />
<br />
anyway, having the top council killed by just anyone, is the opposite of what I said AND meant... however, yes, I do think It should be possible for a group of councils with &quot;just good&quot; players to form an alliance, and beat the top council down... right now the situation is so that if you give the top council's accounts to a bunch of dumbass AND unexperianced players, It would be extremely hard for even very good players to beat the top council... this should not be the case, being in the top council should be a constant struggle, having to work very hard to keep the position... right now this is not the case...<br />
<br />
as for the empire help, you seem to have either misunderstood, or have twisted my words, or both... I do think It could be an interesting twist to make the empire assist players who assit it, with supplies... right now If you displease the empire, it attacks you... what I want it for it to ask others to attack you, and whoever agrees, would receive special help to do so, depending on his standing with the empire...<br />
<br />
anyway, I also have a few more suggestions for tweaks to my changes/other changes:<br />
<br />
first of all, I kinda agree to the &quot;no allied fleets&quot; suggestion, as I think this could really make a big difference... its also quite easy to implement...<br />
<br />
another thing is to make is so the decay of both commanders and ships would be hastier the more ships you have - obviously, there is a limited number of technicians that can repair the ships, and (kinda like in the recent patent industry ;P) when as repair workloads increase, and they have to do their jobs faster with less time to rest, etc..., the repairs arent as good as before... also, bigger ships should decay faster, as they are much more complicated and harder to repair...<br />
yet another tweak for ship decay could be to make it cost pp and not mp - after all, the repair is actually 'rebuilding' part of the ship, and ship production costs pp... I dont know about this one though, as I havent thought it through very thoroughly yet...<br />
<br />
and as for the commanders' accelerated decay when they are numerous, is that they recieve better training, healthcare and etc.. when there are less of them...<br />
maybe it should also become increasingly harder to train more high level commanders the more you already have... maybe by making high level commanders &quot;want&quot; to have 1 level below luitenanants, before they allowe more higher level commanders to be trained...<br />
<br />
oh, and maxtor, Im still waiting to see YOUR suggestions on how to make the game better...			   <P align=right></P>

if you wanna make a suggestion, they have a seperate board for that, its called &quot;Suggestions&quot; and i suggest you look into it, which goes for the rest of you noobs out there.. use the suggestion board to bitch about your weaknesses please, does us all a favour			   <P align=right></P>

Reply : that's the best comment that I'd ever seen<br />
<br />
Btw, I don't wanna make assumption here, so, I was just wondering, how long would you &amp; your 34 people in your 'MAIN' council gonna take to take out TE? 6 months? 1 year? <br />
<br />
Oh Yea, you can go ahead and have it your way, I'm not gonna get dragged into a time wasting situation like this. You can go ahead with your proposed suggestions etc.<br />

			  	WD: no one is asking you to read this, so if you dont like it, the fuck off and go away.<br />
Personally I somewhat like the current situation... however, I happen to be in a minority in my liking this, so im suggesting ways the majority of players might like. other then that, either say you like the current situation and go read some other posts, or say you dont, and write something constructive...<br />
<br />
maxtor:<br />
Im glad we agree on at least one thing :D <br />
as for my council beating TE, I guess well just have to wait and see...<br />
<br />
anyway, im kinda glad you didnt answer my stuff again, cause I got tired of writing :D but seriously now, do you like the current situation? and if not, what would YOU do to change it? (besides bringing better players to the game? :P)			   <P align=right></P>

			  	shwouchkie, shut up.<br />
<br />
Think carefully about your suggestion before you post it, and do take into consideration that all the limits you slap on to people can come back to bite you in the ass. People wanted limitations on admission requests and council fusions, and now some people are stuck in perma-war. And now you want to put limitations on war and further limit allied fleets. Honestly, a good portion of the people bitching about things will bitch regardless of what you do to the game. Every limitation made aggrivates at least some players, and serious changes like perma councils kill player's manueverability; the capability to join a council of his or her's choice.<br />
<br />
Lower attack range would be fine with more players, but... unless the vast majority of players are fine with very few people they can hit...<br />
<br />
Ship decay? Wow, no. High tech ships don't decay fast, especially considering that, oh yeah, there's this whole repair/organice armor thing. Makes loads of sense to decay ships. ;)<br />
<br />
Allied fleets? There are &quot;legit&quot; uses of allied fleets. It's already been limited quite alot. <br />
<br />
The problems are not neccisarly entirely GAME related either. It's partly a player thing too.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't matter what you do to the game, the active, strong, and aggresive councils will always dominate, unless you turn it into NoobSpace, or one of those games where activity is the #1 decider of the dominant council/guild/etc., which I doubt any of us really want. Yes, changes and limitations are good, but don't change the game into a completely different game. (I'm talking mostly to the players making suggestions here, not the devs.)<br />
<br />
Bitching till your on top without much work isn't going to work, at least I hope it doesn't work. Archspace is about teamwork and strategy; councils, not about player vs. player. Is it possible to take down TE next set? Yes. This set? Prooobably not, but you never know. Koreans could easilly be on top next set again. A council dedicated to taking down TE and probably the Koreans could easilly be on top. As I believe Gumpus put it, &quot;...no one ever does [last on top].&quot; Instead of bitching for changes that make the game easier to play for you, why don't you DO something about it? In-game maybe?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm done with my rant on 4-hours of sleep.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Cyph, you are partly right. But you know as well as I do, the reset is decided in the first 24-48 hours, isnt that fucked up?<br />
<br />
Moreover, yes, it's also a problem of lack of players. But let's see I bet since Mind re-started AS there were 1500-2000 different players in all those 6 resets or so. But more and more (even oldschool players) leaving every set. <br />
AS is so unique and great you can attract new players for sure, but can you keep them? 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	cy, you can go suck on my balls. you have turned just about everything I have said on its head...<br />
<br />
I would be the last one to bitch about the game, as the current changed that were made, brought me back. as I already sai, I fairly like the situation, so fuck off.<br />
<br />
yes, of course even high tech shit decays... and as for organic, self repairing armor? if its organic, it ages = decays.<br />
<br />
I dont need those changed, and quite like the game as it is, with only one exception - we have too little players...<br />
<br />
as keyan rightly noted, we had a nice starting amount, but many left... I believe the reason to that was all the crap going on in the past.. (which were also a part of my reason for leaving...) as I have come back with the changes, so I hope others will come, and new people will join... however, I can still see some major dissatisfaction from a big part of the community... this, in part motivated me to suggest the changes - this dissatisfaction could make yet more players turn to seek other games, more to their liking... and frankly, if this game had a massive player base, (i.e. ~6k+) most of the changes that were made wouldnt have been needed, as gameplay would have still been very dynamic... as it is now, we are a small community, with an even smaller community of experianced players, and all the work that can be done needs to be done to:<br />
1. keep small playerbase gameplay fun<br />
2. keep players addicted :P<br />
3. bring new masses of players...<br />
<br />
the only way to achieve no. 3, affectively is either by mass advertisement, or by mouth-ear...<br />
<br />
however for the mouth-ear method to work, this game needs to be in a state where people would sometimes suddnely remember it, and tell their friends about it... as of now, I dont see myself telling them about it...<br />
<br />
and thats why changes are needed 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Just like to point one thing out: Reverse Entropy. That knowldge would give immortality to your commies (that or ascension take your pick, but the knowldge you end up with in AS, you are not bound by materialistic limitations, afterall one of the techs allows you to create your own realms, with your own rules) and your organic armor under effects of RE will also live forever. Also lets not forget, you, the ruler live through all of this the whole time and eventially overthrow the empire, so you are either magically godlike and invlunerable, living forever, or just not a lot of time passes.  (oh yeah i do believe that long ago we established the official time to be 7 minutes ingame for a turn passing :P )<br />
<br />
Anyway commander decay != fun. I do not see how it helps anyone? other then taking away a good gameplay feature. <br />
<br />
Ship decay is just illogical. Lets take a look at the end result you want: limited ships. Thats basically what it is. Then just either put a ship limit or increase Upkeep costs severally. Remember any new changes/additions, that the golden rule is to keep it simple. Just like math always simplify your equations, so that you may slove the problem :P<br />
<br />
Im not sure however however if it will indeed help the game or not :/<br />
<br />
Anyway thats all i have to say for now,<br />

			  	Hey um, I'd just like to point out one small thing to you, shwouchkie... GENERALLY SHIPS IN ARMADAS ARE UPKEPT. Hulls that can take fucking black holes being thrown at them are going to take just a tad bit long to decay, no? Especially if they're being FIXED ON A REGULAR BASIS, unless your empire's leader is shwouchkie. Then you just leave your perfectly good full tech dooms sitting around rusting (even if there is nothing to rust your dooms...), because obviously there's no better way to use them. Like maybe expanding his empire... Oh wait, haha, what am I thinking. Expanding is for noobz. Let your dooms decay! winzz!!! Oh, and obviously an armor named &quot;Eternium&quot; will decay within like... a day. Yeah. It makes sense. wtf was I thinking?<br />
<br />
&quot;The name says it all. This is the strongest and most durable armor available. The main drawback is that it is impossible to repair during combat. However, this armor can take so much abuse, that it is rarely necessary to repair it.&quot;<br />
lolz wimpy sauce armor lolz<br />
<br />
Anyway, what Shadowman said, and now I really want to know more about whatever the hell Reverse Entropy is. ;p Gonna have to go read a little on it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Keyan, I agree, there is something wrong with that, but I don't think many of hte suggestions being put forth will actually help.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Entropy is the effect of things becoming more disordered.  It has the label delta S and is always negative.  For this reason, it has also been nicknamed the arrow of time.  To reverse entropy is to give order where there was none and not lose energy.  Or for the process to be spontaneous.  It's the reason why that tech is so high.  To reverse Entropy is to control the essence of everything.  You can bring to order things that are meant to be disordered.  An eggshell will spontaneously transform from the shattered pieces.  Like watching a film in reverse.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	LOL, Psycholis, sounds like you have taken some chemistry classes in your life. Thats the kind of thing you learn about in high school chem, and more in University (I am majoring in Chem right now). The problem with entropy, is that the world and indeed the whole universe is becoming more and more disorganised as time passes. In fact, things which you think are making it more ordered (eg, turning a gas into a solid), are actually increasing the entropy, because of the processes you do in order to create less disorder in an object. <br />
<br />
Houston<br />
<br />
PS, its good for all you kids who need an excuse for why you leave a mess, or shouldn't clean your room. (&quot;I'm sorry mom/dad but because of the laws of entropy, my room tends to evolve to more ad more disorder and I can't stop it&quot;)			   <P align=right></P>

			  	lol houston, youre funny :D<br />
I have only one correction to make, and is that studies of entropy are more physics related then chemistry related...<br />
<br />
and cypher, In case you didnt understand the first time, let me say it loud and clear - I DONT GIVE A FUCK ANYMORE you dont have to spend energy bashing my theories - I withdraw them... I got tired of arguing to make changes to a game I already like....<br />
<br />
so instead of thinking up of ways on how to discredit my previous suggestions, why wont YOU think up on some? (after all, you admitted youself that you agree with keyan) or is actually creating shit too hard for you, so you must go and look for ways to destroy others' to inflate your ego?<br />

			  	Maybe right shwouchk...the problem with sciences is that they overlap a lot. (Hence the reason why it is not 2x as hard to take, say biology and chemistry, since they often voerlap material it is only a little bit harder). In Canada, or at least at the high school and university I go to, Entropy is only covered under the inorganic chemistry courses, not under my physics....weird weird world.<br />

Haha. You have a problem with me pointing out illogical shit and that alot of things people are suggesting won't have the effect that they're aiming for? And no, I'm not going to go on a suggestion rampage throwing every idea I can pull out of my ass. I do not know how to change the game for the better. It's a complex issue, and there are alot of different opinions coming from different areas and different desired directions of the game coming from different people. I don't know what the game -really- needs. Not many of us have a fucking clue. There are a few changes coming up that may make things a little better. I just hope the changes don't go extreme, like the empire (nice job guys who repeatedly asked that empire be strengthened). Extreme changes without testing them first are a baaaad idea, in my honest opinion. Also, I believe that a good portion of hte problem is player-based, and not so much game-related.			   <P align=right></P>

I think its been long established who is the dumbass  of the two of us. (you have three guesses, and its not me)<br />
<br />
as for you bashing my suggestions? go ahed, I have no problems with that.. i just saidthat  its not neccesary, since I withdrew them already... I could keep arguing with you for 1000s more lines, which is precisely why I stopped here - let me assure you it was not your dumb notes...<br />
however, you had to go bash them - i.e have the last word - which just shows what an asshole you are - IF my suggestions wouldnt have been good, they were withdrawn - theres no more need to bash them in futile attempts to inflate your ego... but I guess thats just how you are...<br />
And this whole speech? you could have just said you dont have any ideas. at least id have respected that.. but instead you just threw all that crap... in short, giving suggestions, even bad ones, is better then giving none... if every scientist wouldnt have tried to persuade his theories in fear they might be wrong, we'd still be sitting in trees and collecting shrubs, and looking with amazement at fire...<br />
<br />
as for the extreme changed note? that was totally stupid... in case you havent noticed, you are playing in a beta-staged game... thats right, thats when all the neat new features get tested...<br />
how are the features supposed to be tested without incorporating them into the game?<br />
go figure...			   <P align=right></P>

			  	shwouchk, just shut up. People are going to make suggestions, and if the suggestions contradict yours, so-fucking-be it. The thread's not about forcing your ideas down the devs' (and everyone else's) throats, we're trying to improve the game. If you can't handle someone disagreeing with you, in a sane, adult manner, then get the fuck out of here. <br />
<br />
To the rest, watching this board with much interest (and no small amount of hope). 			   <P align=right></P>

summing it all up, youre a braindead moron... nobody in this thread made a suggestion that contradicted mine, and if you read carefully, youll notice that I ASKED THEM to make their own suggestions, no less then 5 times! so far, no one has...<br />
<br />
so instead of coming here to flame, why dont YOU make some of your own suggestions? until then, go suck on your mommy's nipple for a couple more years...			   <P align=right></P>

			  	@shwouchk:<br />
Nah, summing it all up, fucktard, you asked'em to make their own suggestions, but when they did you insulted them anyway, e.g. Maxtor. He disagreed with you, and instead of responding civilly like any of the others, you just ~had~ to throw in a few insults. Fucktard, plenty of people made their own suggestions, you just seem to enjoy dismissing them. <br />
<br />
And I'm not making any suggestions cos I'm relatively new to this game, and I ain't about to argue against the pros who've been doing this for years. I trust edead and Maxtor and Cy and ziu and the rest of'em.<br />
<br />
And thank you for the insight as to your sexual deviations, but you realize that not everyone likes givin' it the way you do.<br />
<br />
(Btw, I'd be more inclined to feel like a 'braindead moron' if you actually knew how to use the apostrophe.)<br />

			  	hm, now i have read through it all pehw....<br />
Here is my opinion: Im still the Ubernoob :D<br />
<br />
There isnt anything wrong with the game when a noob like me can have so much fun.<br />
<br />
Im looking forward to next reset when im not noob and can play from day one.  So dont go make any major changes just when i am getting the hang of this game again.  <br />

Investigation Report and Comment by the author:<br />
1. This is *NOT* the board for suggestions. The Forum Mods already have provided us with that board, and its not this board. So dont ask for other people's suggestions or put any suggestions about/to the game at this thread or any of the thread here at this board.<br />
<br />
2. If you think that their comments about your reply/post arent relatively close to the &quot;answers&quot; you were looking for. Then please clarify your previous post to your next post/reply to that post of the author of that comment. This is to ensure that both parties/authors would grant respect to each other and to the reads of your posts.<br />
<br />
3. Comments are *NOT* insults, nor its close to an insult.<br />
<br />
4. Comments may be GOOD or BAD but if it is posted in a subtle manner, try not to overlook it as a harmful/aggresive reply.<br />
<br />
5. Most readers of a forum tends to look at the thread first if they can &quot;handle&quot; (relates to: TIME/COMFORTABILITY/LAZINESS) to read the posts of the threads. Then they'll start to read if they can &quot;handle&quot; it.<br />
<br />
5.cont. Try to refrain on replying/commenting to the post by every part of it that you are willing to reply/comment to. REPHRASE: by using quotes on every paragraph/the line that you would reply to.<br />
<br />
~ MY COMMENTS ARE DIRECTED NOT ONLY TO THE ONES WHO POSTED HERE AT THIS THREAD BUT TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT POSTED TO THE OTHER THREADS AND THE READERS.<br />
~ I'M IMPRESSED BY HOW YOU HANDLE THE LANGUAGE(ENGLISH), BUT NOT THE LANGUAGE ALONE MAKES YOU BEING CLASSIFIED AS A GOOD COMMENTATOR. <br />
