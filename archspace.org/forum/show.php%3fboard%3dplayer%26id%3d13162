			  			Well Folks, looks like we're finally out of Beta. After successive stagnant years under MARI and a year(or two) when Archspace dissapeared off the face of the Net, we're finally back.<br />
<br />
Beta has ended and the game is now set with a few minor bugs left to be ironed out from the major tweaking of races, weapons etc.<br />
<br />
The number of people that can be expected to play in this set is estimated at approximately 1.5k (According to Mind).<br />
<br />
Full server-side IRC has been implemented, ensuring easy access to communication links for Councils.<br />
<br />
A new system ala Archmage has been put in place to prevent a quick-death, i.e protection mode enabled to let the newbies get a grasp of the game mechanics and not simply be pounded into the dust.<br />
<br />
This represents a new beginning for Archspace, for a lot of us die-hard fans and Vets who've been here through the tumulous years hoping for MARI to pass down the source code to someone else, so that we could once again enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
A lot of us remember Buzzrock, the old MOD during the MARI days who tried to get AS from Garcia but failed. I still remember how we supported him with prayers and gratuitous hope but in the end we came out with nothing, the proposed saviour having failed.<br />
<br />
That, was until MindLock Security and MindWarper took the reins of Archspace in early 2002. The first few sets of AS were tenuous to say the least. The code being used was from an earlier version of Archspace, extremely buggy and according to our resident programmer DT, &quot;Inter-dependent and extremely crappy&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't well planned out and so a lot of things were done poorly (inefficiently), and i had to rewrite the whole database backend because their method created a huge memory inflation and cpu usage&quot;<br />
<br />
That in itself, took some time as our proggrammers aren't professional full-timers(they're working for free). The newly rewritten code, meanwhile, had to be tested on the Dev server while the Public Archspace server continued to experience major problems including mass allegations of cheating and widespread disaffection at the state of the game(It used to be noob-unfriendly).<br />
<br />
Code aside, the debacle of a super-council mass-retiring and giving up their planets to boost their friends created such a fiasco that eventually, a few sets down the road, that very council left Archspace, never to be seen again.(Hopefully they'll come back this set though certain quarters seemed adamant in their disapproval)<br />
<br />
At one point, the situation was such that a lot of the Vets simply left or stopped playing. Interest about Archspace dropped to a record low.<br />
<br />
However, with perserverence not seen even remotely close anywhere else(well except for Dave), the programmers worked on and slowly but surely, after almost two years working, the rough-edged but almost-completed product was rolled off the assembly line.<br />
<br />
Sure, the code and server isnt perfect but at least, there won't be deliberate crashes, cheating and milking anymore. The programmer's are still working very hard to refine the code and make it as perfect as possible.<br />
<br />
With this, i salute those who've worked hard for the past two years, including MindWarper, Zbyte, DarkTempes, Embryodead, Seiffer and anyone else whom i've missed out.(It wasn't intentional. Really!)<br />
<br />
Without you guys, the game wouldnt be here.<br />
<br />
Like the new main page(with its supercool pic) and the sleek forum design, this new Archspace reset truly heralds the dawn of a new era for Archspace.<br />
<br />

			  	Thank you for your kind words =). This has not been an easy path for any of us, players, devs, it doesn't matter. But the era of the bugs has been long in archspace from the very beginning to today. Apache errors still reign supreme in the minds and hatred of many vets. TheDAZ leaving was a sad day for Archspace, our future was unsure. Buzzrock, although he and I did not see eye to eye, he did his damndest for us and even he too folded. Now however, we have a dedicated development team who will make sure your game is enjoyable and *hopefully* crashfree. I have spent the last week trying to crash the dev server, not easy anymore. The game is also much more balanced now, things are usable, things will not absolutely decimate everything else. With this new era comes a new class of players...<br />
