			  			No, seriously, I have no idea why someone from a top ten council should even be able to hit someone from a rank 45 council with 4 members.  This twice power attack BS needs to be toned down.  Alright, granted, it might have been a call for allied support, cause everyone and their grandma has called on a top ten brother at some time to come save their ass.  I'm just tired of this being a one-sided game.  If a small council in the lower ranking is having it's small war with another council, they shouldn't have to worry about people in the top ten coming down and destroying their whole fleet without reprise.  So much for 1 on 1 wars.  Like my colleague of Illuminati, I've had enough of this allied BS.  I swear if all players played like we did this set, and feinted of big hitters with only two members, this game would be a lot more interesting.  As it stands, I don't know what else I can say on the matter that I haven't ranted about in some other post.  If there's some flaw in my reasoning, or my logic, or whatever, feel free to point it out to me, because I think I'm being level-headed and fair in this matter.  You lost my vote for AS.						<P align=right> </P>

			  	My 2 cents on the matter since I was the one attacked.<br />
<br />
While I don't hold anything against anyone for calling in allies during a war, I can't say I totally agree with it.  In this case, someone warred us, and after I lost a planet and my friends lost nearly their entire fleets but kept trying to attack.. their council forced a truce on us.  We warred them again in order to get our planets back, and I finally gave in, fleeted my stored up dooms, and proceeded to defleet my attacker.  I took one planet from 2 members and then stopped.  I'm not in control of my friends, so I can't tell them to stop raping, no matter how much I don't like it.  I don't even do random blockades to build up commies.<br />
<br />
But anyway, this raping aggrivated (obviously) the other council so they either called in for reinforcements or I have just had a extremely bad case of luck.  It just seemed too timed to have been the latter, but I dunno.  <br />
<br />
Calling for help is okay.. but they originally warred us and then proceeded to get their butt in trouble. :/  Were we thought of as easy targets or an actual good fight?  I don't know.  I was certainly done attacking after my 2 planets, though I can't speak for Jason, who I thouroughly intend to beat up at college on Tuesday anyway. &gt;_&gt;  He owes me some Jamba Juice for all this crap.<br />
<br />
I don't even know what I'm trying to say with this.  It's late, I have class in the morning, and here I sit angsting over my precious dooms which take me forever to build 'cause I'm Bosalian.  ;_;  My pretties..<br />
<br />
Sounds more like an LJ entry than a AS forum post. &lt;3			   <P align=right></P>

			  	AS is absolutely unbalanced. That is among others the attack range and the effect of commanders which is huge. <br />
Let's say there are 50 average skilled 100k players, can they take down a skilled guy with good commies and 1 mil fleet power? I doubt so. <br />
<br />
Last set, 4 of our guys declared war on whole AS (+600 players) because council hopping was nerfed and guess what, nobody could even scratch them... how can this be possible?<br />
<br />
This game is really fucked up :/ But I have no clue either how to balance it :S 			   <P align=right></P>

			  	It's not taking it too seriously man. I mean if the crappy blockade can't be stop for commie leveling of high power this game will loose some player again. I got blocaded 2 time this set for no reason and i am still trying to recover the fleet power loss. Being at 100k power and go down to about 45k cuz some one can't try something on a player of his strengt is no cool at all. It just make people sick of this game and they will eventually leave this one sieded game.<br />

			  	Well, for the random blockades, I have a solution - instead of training fleets, train the commanders! You can select commanders to train from the pool, and judging by their interpretation (or whatever that worthless stat is), the cost of training per turn is computed and your genius determines the amount of XP earned.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Either that or lower the 50 percent range for individual players, to something like 75% to 150%. Its quite obvious that a person with half your power cannot protect himself against you if you are'nt fluffed or planet fat. This would encourage a wider range of player powers in a council and thus reduce raping incidents.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	&quot;Its quite obvious that a person with half your power cannot protect himself against you if you are'nt fluffed or planet fat.&quot; Not always.<br />
<br />
Reduce the range and you reduce your council's flexability, and lower the number of battles you enter. Also, if you ever played during the Mari times, you will probably recall being pissed off when you'd break someone, and you get one planet. The weaker people in your council, often the useless members, feed upon the weakened opponent' planets, assuming you're not in an organized council. Good stuff, eh? Perhaps a limit on blockades while not at war. Would limit the gayness of masses of allies a bit too, no?<br />
<br />
What exactly is this 'one-sided' thing about anyway?			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Hmm, reducing the player range, but leaving the council 50% to 200% range might work.<br />
But true, you don't get much planets off a person if he were to fall out of ur range the moment he is defleeted.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	intellect - you can already train the commanders ... Training missions give 1000-5000 XP to a commander per 2 hour mission. The exact amount depends on the number and size of ships he commands + military CM, but will be 1000 XP most of the time, unless you use dreads+<br />
<br />
This works very well at the beginning, but later when you have lots of commanders it's too tiring without fleeter.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	As a groggy-headed fuzzball who just woke up.. I have only one idea.<br />
<br />
Only be able to attack people in your fleet power rage, not total power range.  It wouldn't matter how many techs or planets one has.. or even what the council power is.<br />
<br />
..or is it this way already?  I'm waaaaaaay mnrg and stuffs. &lt;3			   <P align=right></P>

<br />
Thanks for the thought, but does that mean that someone with no fleets can't be attacked?  When a council get declared on, everyone just disbands all of their fleets?<br />
<br />
Don't you think there should be a penalty for players that have a whole mess of planets but no fleets to protect them?<br />
<br />
Just a few things to think about, but keep on trying.  The more suggestions that are floated around, the better.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I have found AN AMAZING way to train commies...just steal a magistrate planet, and they will constantly attack you for days, even after they get their own planet back, plus a handful of yours, and you have no fleets (ie are no longer a threat to them)...get a lot of fleeted ships, and change the commies every few hours...I got 5 lvl 20's in a matter of a couple hours, and if i had the ships, could have likely trained a few dozen lvl 20's within a day or 2.<br />

			  	edead: The training I was referring to was training without fleeting the commanders. Do you really think commanders would sit around all day, or even all week/year without training. NO! They'd have to train somehow, so, maybe have a commander training option that involves them sitting in a classroom, not being fleeted. It would remove the commander from your pool, sort of like the Targoid Breeder Male, then when he returns, he would have gained X amount of experience. There could even be a cap of level on the training, that you couldn't get level 20 from commander training and would have to do fleet training.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Maybe instead of fleet power, it could be actual ship power.  Like.. the amount of stuff they have in the pool is included too.  It can't be the fault of others that those ships weren't fleeted.<br />
<br />
I went back to bed and dreamed about this:  If someone attacked a weaker player, their commanders lose experience.<br />
<br />
And they get a bad event: Commander Vacation.  &quot;Your commanders have decided to take some time off and visit a paradise planet where they proceed to get totally wasted.  This has a harsh impact on their commanding level.&quot;<br />
<br />
And all the commanders were back to level 1. XD<br />
<br />
Yes, I dream odd things. &lt;3<br />
<br />
Edit:  YAY, I'm dead now!  I can spend the rest of this set angsting in the forums!  *teasing*			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Also, maybe there would be a way to incorperate a thing of commander power - but that might be knowing too much info and people would never attack one another unless their commanders were in the same range.  :l			   <P align=right></P>
