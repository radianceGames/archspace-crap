			  			Obviously youll say kind of &quot;another whiny noob&quot;..im telling you few things wich you are aware of them:<br />
<br />
1.you are greatly loosing players continues, few remain to play the game i even brought abt 30 active players from wich 5 remained!<br />
<br />
THE GAME IS WAAAAAAAY TO UNBALANCED.<br />
<br />
Sugestions:<br />
<br />
1.make blockade available only in war. that way no more lame atacks or ops from twice bigger mofo outside your wars.<br />
<br />
2.make privateer more usefull...looting 200 PP is not worthing.<br />
<br />
3.Make limited war numbers..my sugestions is:<br />
<br />
-each council can declare up to 3 wars and can be declared up to 2 councils! to avoid unfair gangbangs.<br />
<br />
MOST IMPORTANT:<br />
<br />
-atacking declaration or atacking range for any council/player to be 10% lower power up to 50% higher...stop the mofos feeding on the newcomers...the 20k power guy rape a barelly started of 10k power...fair enough?..dont mention later when 200k power vs 100k.<br />
<br />
As results for this changes will have a much balanced game and also a bit longer set. none can outgrow since must have targets to rape for planets.instead of 5 players of 100 planets wich gangbang the server will have 50 players of 10-20 planets wich grow altogheter if they war between(just an example)<br />
<br />
think to that and implement it ASAP.<br />
<br />
As for me..i resume my time this set just to screw and ruin the top 10 council....<br />
<br />
I WILL MAKE HUUUUUUUGE USE OF THE UNBALANCED issues in game...youll see what i mean and hope will be changed<br />
<br />
best regards, and zbyte/ryan sorry if i was a bit offensive but i lost 3 active players due to lame blockades on them from outsiders..they quit AS<br />
<br />

			  	Figured I might throw this out there, it's from a post I made in the players forum - just realized it's the wrong thread :S<br />
<br />
&quot;First and formost whether the dynamics of blockading in this game are realistic in comparison to present day blockades - &quot;real life&quot; blockades - is beside the point, this is a game and sometimes realism has to be sacrificed for gameplay. Blockading is what I would rank as the #1 problem with this game.<br />
1. Blockades and relative power rankings: Do you know what someone with 100k power does to someone with 50k power when blockading? Do you know how huge a power difference this actually is? I'm sure almost everyone in AS has experienced one or both ends of this, and I would like to ask each and every one of you whether you think this is a healthy aspect of AS.<br />
2. Blockades as a leveling mechanism: This ties back in with the point raised earlier about how difficult it is to access the top councils in this game. How can the said player with 50k power ever hope to become more powerful when he's constantly getting blocked by the top council members (who are always eager to get their commanders more experience) and defleeted??? Is THIS a healthy aspect of the game?<br />
3. Blockades; a &quot;reality check&quot;: Some might argue that the way blockades in this game work is realistic, and therefor not want to change it. If blockades in real life worked like they do in this game picture this scenario: America decides to blockade Cuba for one reason or another. They send their best equipped, most advanced battleships and surround the island. The Cubans, seeing this (and compelled by some great desire for their own destruction), all jump in their rowboats and rafts and, toting handguns and rifles, hurry out to meet their enemies head on! If I were the commander of a fleet of 10 cruisers - belonging to the said 50k powered player - and I saw about 100 battlecruisers sitting outside of one of my planets I don't think I would try to take them on. My point is Blockading should not be on the terms of the attacker, but of the defender.<br />
<br />
If Blockading is to remain a part of Archspace I would suggest of these changes be made.<br />
A: Blockading should be an all-encompassing method of attack, rather than a planet-based one. A blockade, when set up, should halt production and commerce of planets within a certain system rather than just one planet. This would give a reason to want to blockade rather than just doing it to gain experience. You may be thinking right now &quot;that wouldn't solve anything!&quot; but when combined with a few more measures you'll see why it's necessary.<br />
<br />
B. Blockading should be on the terms of the defender. The defender should be able to see the ships the enemy is using against him; the size category of the ships, number of ships, and number of fleets. In a blockade the fleets would have to stick around for a while to pull off the blockade, so scouting would be available. This brings up another point: blockading should not be instantaneous. Fleets should stick around for a certain number of rounds, depending on how long they wish to stop production. There should be a minimum and maximum number of ticks blockading ships would need to stick around. The minimum representing how long they need to be there to effectively stop production, the maximum being how soon their supplies run out. The defender should be able to decide whether or not his fleets attack the blockading fleets. In fact the blockading fleets should be listed as an attack option (like you can attack players in the seige planet menu). This way there is no &quot;surprise&quot; blockading (which I think is rather oxymoronical (like that word???)).<br />
<br />
C: Blockading's power range should not be proportional, but rather a set amount of power. Example: 1,000,000 power and 500,000 power is a HUGE difference, but if we set the amount to a certain amount of power rather than a percent it would prevent such lopsided battles at high levels. For example if we set the amount to 20k power, at low power levels blockading would be more of an option; you'll have more targets, potentially quite a bit weaker than you, but at this point in the game the chances are you won't want to blockade, since everyone is still struggling to establish themselves. Then as you approach the 50k power range the 20k range is about what it is now - 50 percent. Then as you get into the 100k range the 20k range is restricting, preventing you from picking on lesser players.<br />
<br />
D: If blockading's power range remains proportional, that proportion needs to be greatly decreased.<br />
<br />
This is all I have time for now, sorry I wrote this in a rush and probabaly overlooked stuff. Please respond, let me know what I missed/overlooked :D&quot;<br />

			  	A few things off the top of my head that I never brought up in that post:<br />
<br />
1.  Blockading as an option only usable in war.<br />
2.  Fleets can't leave for war when their planets are being blockaded.  This would only come into play if blockading was made to be a more-than-one-turn action, which I think realistically and for balancing issues it should be.<br />
3.  Obviously not ALL these changes could be implimented at once; I truly believe that even one of these changes would help a great deal though.  Blockading is, in my opinion, - and a lot of the other gamers' opinions I'm sure - the #1 priority on the AS to do list.  If some of this takes a lot of rewriting a simple fix that would probably take very little work would be either GREATLY decrease the range in which you can blockade, or make it only performable in war circumstances.  I honestly believe that taking blockading out of the game entirely is better than leaving it in under these circumstances.  Hope someone gets on it!  (I know I post a lot of suggestions, please don't misinterpret this as whining, being angry at the AS team, or taking them for granted.  I still believe AS is a great game, and appreciate all the work that's gone into it.)<br />

			  	1) Blockading will not be restricted to wars only.<br />
2) I dunno why privateers are still so useless<br />
3) Balance issues are constantly being looked at, we have quite a few things in store.<br />
4) I am hungry.<p><br>__________________________________________________<br />

			  	Just because blockading will not be restricted to wars only does not necessarily mean the mods aren't doing anything about it.  I personally think restricting blockades to a war-based offensive action would render them obsolete.  I would rank that as the last possible resort, although I would rank it above keeping blockading in the game under current conditions.  If the mods are looking at balancing issues, this will probably be the first thing they look at.  I personally couldn't believe they wouldn't do anything about blockading, since it is the biggest problem with the game currently.  Until I see a lack of interest in balancing and instead an interest in dominating the game on the part of the mods I will remain hopeful.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	I really like Slayer's ideas for blockading - IMO it makes it more of a blockade than a fleet action with a bit of an economical effect on the target planet (which would be similar to the US Navy sailing to the main Canadian naval ports, smashing the Canadian ships to bits and pieces, and then returning to the US thinking nothing out of the ordinary has happened LOL)...but it'd take a fair amount fo coding to get it working most likely.<br />
<br />
If blockades became more like blockades than fleet battles, I'd definately agree they should be available when not at war.  As it is the only way not to be massacred by a blockade is to station your fleets, but if you get attacked afterwards and you aren't on you'll lose a lot of your planets - which is a lose-lose situation.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	For balancing issues I think it would make more sense to change the power ratios rather than change the options themself. Like for blockade make it 20% below and 50% above and maybe change siege so that it uses a smaller percentage while in a normal war, but goes to 50% below and above when in total war.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	Blockades are the worst balancing issue with this game if it isnt fixed I cant justify continueing to play and if I quit most likly all of my friends who are all active players will quit as well. At this point I have goten 10 people to start playing. Yes I know beggers shouldn't be chosers, and I admit that I haven't been playing that long. However, free or not, am I wrong in thinking that you guys would like more people to play this game? A game that you have spent so much time on and probably have much pride in? Well if so, than this needs to be fixed or newbies simply aren't going to enjoy the game and ultimately quit (just as me and my friends are considering doing). Well, I would hate to just complain and not offer any solutions so heres a few ideas my friends and I have been throwing around that I don't think have been suggeted yet.<br />
<br />
   1.  Simply make it so it takes longer for ships to return from a blockade.<br />
<br />
   2.  Blockades last 12 hours; or when you call your ships back sort of like the way sending ships to your allys works.<br />
<br />
   3.  Make an option that lets you choose whether or not your ships will defend against a blockade.<br />
<br />
   4. A method a friend suggested that might be a better way to handle blockading that would more fit what blockading is...<br />
When you send ships to blockade a planet, the production of that planet is reduced to 25%. It is similar to stationing ships to a planet in that they stay there until they are recalled (at which point it will take several turns for them to return.) <br />
The commanders will gain a significant amount of experience, but the person being blockaded and losing production would be the one to initiate any combat, the defending player attacking the blockade as one would seige a planet. Otherwise, no combat would take place.<br />
<br />
I dont know if these would work or not but something needs to be done to solve this issue. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the time and consideration. <br />
<br />

			  	Slayer's ideas rock. Blockading now is absolutely pointless except to gain commander experience. And definitely not the most valiant way to do so either.<br />
<br />
A blockade is to station a large number of ships around a planet (or cluster, according to one of Slayer's suggestions) to stop all physical traffic to and from the planet. A blockading fleet won't come, wipe out defences, and then just leave immediately. That's called a massacre, not a Blockade.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the devs have no intention of changing the game mechanics of the &quot;blockade&quot;, at least use a more apt word for it. Like &quot;Life-Target Practice&quot; or something. (Forgive the sarcasm. I couldn't help it.) :P<br />
<br />
BTW, please take care of the (sometimes dumb) newbies. Now its a rather harsh punishment for building too many destroyers early on. It's really frustrating to try to build defences, form your defence plan, etc, then be blockaded and totally destroyed by a single HBH doom fleet. And to add insult to injury, the home side didn't even fire a single shot.<br />
<br />
Lastly, this is a suggestion board, not a complaint board or a flaming board. I've seen that happen a few times already. I hope everyone realises the reason for the existence of this forum.<p><br>.			   <P align=right></P>

			  	First off, thanks for the positive feed :D  It's good to know someone out there agrees with me.  Now mods, you've said what you WON'T do about blockading, it'd be nice to know what you ARE going to do.  I quit this set because I got blockaded 13 times.  13.  Yes, that's right, every time I got my power up to around 100k somebody would decide I'm worth blockading, send in a five fleets of HBH doomstars, and of course my 6 fleets of dreadnaughts would be like &quot;Let's go guys!&quot; and fly in to their deaths.<br />
<br />
One thing I was thinking might make sense, if it would be hard to write (but remember I'm just throwing as many viable suggestions out there as possible in hope that y'all will pick one up), would be allowing commanders to use the &quot;interperatation&quot; skill to interperate incoming blockades/seiges to kinda pick and choose which ones to defend.  When I really think about it, however realistic and balancing it may be, this idea would probably screw the game up quite a bit.  Raping would no longer be possible, because the commanders seeing the first wave come in would probably say screw it, let em have the planet, and then all the smaller raping fleets would get picked off.  Blockading someone half your power would no longer make sense, since the commanders would probably decide they don't care.  The most important commander ability for leading fleets on the defense would become interpretation.  This one change would change the face of the game quite dramatically, and so I guess this is just something to think about.  Maybe someday eh?<br />
