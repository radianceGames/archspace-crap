God I hate EGAD!!
I'd just bought a new Hamster after Archspace ate my last one and it has gone missing.

I know Dream has eaten it after all everyone knows that EGAD are the source of all evil!!

I even have proof of EGAD being related to the start of the Black plague and the Shooting of JFK!

Quick lets attack them before anymore furry rodents go missing!

I also think that EGAD was responsible for the invention of money, which all know is the root of true evil, and created the Democratic Party, a terribly evil organization with nefarious plans. This might also explain why my woodchuck has also turned up missing.
EGAD, return my woodchuck at once, it was a gift from Myraid Dragon and I don't think it will taste good either, so give him back.

Yes, you never know until you try though Dorsai, and I haven't eaten woodchuck before....mm, hamster wasnt as bad as I thoght it would be either, I think its an acquired taste however.
As for the Democratic party, how did you find out about that little plot? Yes, by manipulating the well meaning but decidedly naieve members of the organization we had hoped to take control of all the small pet stores in the states, allowing for an almost unlimited supply of hamsters..and woodchucks of course...

AHHHH, my woodchuck!!! Will I never again hear his little chi chi sounds? Never pet his wire-like fur? Never again smell his nasty odour? Never again get stiches for his flesh-rending bites? Oh, sad day indeed it is, I will now go and drink Dorsai whiskey and sing songs to my lamented woodchuck.
Be warned oh EGAD, this is not done between us. I will unite rodent lovers everywhere and expose your perfidy. Shame that you would consume our furry rodent friends. Shame that you would create the Democratic Party. Shame for any other evil that I just can't think of right now, but that are probably responsible for.

Ok, so EGAD invented the love of money. Same difference, well almost.
Dorsai! thinks. It is hard but he tries for the love of his woodchuck. 

&quot;If dinner tomorrow, then woodchuck not cooked yet. If woodchuck not cooked yet, may still be alive. If still alive, need to rescue!&quot;

With these words, the Dorsai! commander leaps onto the back of his trusty dragon friend, Myraid Dragon, draws his mono-molecular edged Sword of Eternium and flies to the stronghold of EGAD. After beating all of EGAD's flunkies(nothing extraordinary, just your usual battle against impossible odds, one man and a dragon, managing to beat an entire army through sheer will, force of arms and of course, it's in the script) the Dorsai! commander and Myraid Dragon discover the woodchuck, still alive and caged, along with countless other rodents, including a passel of lemmings, imprisioned and awaiting their culinary death. Thinking quickly, the intrepid two begin to release all the rodents, the woodchuck first of course. Then suddenly the door to the dungeon flies open and there stands the members of EGAD in all their evil, rodent eating glory. The Dorsai! commander, Myraid Dragon and the woodchuck form up together, knowing that they are doomed but determined to sell their lives as dearly as possible when suddenly...

Yes, the server, very tricky on our part. We knew you all would get fed up with it, so we made it slow. all we have to do is wait for you to leave and then we can have you planets 
Yes, Lemming cooked on the grill, with some grass founishings and DIET Coke sauce, which we invented form the hampster and woodchuck stews, is VERY DELICIOUS!! You all should try it  We've having a get-to-gether dinner soon, with all our best dishes. Your all welcome to come, but you have to bring your own woodchucks, hampsters and lemmings for us to prepare.

This post is getting weird  
EGADs the one who got the idiot of a math teacher I have at school hired. He is not only boring, but everyone gets bad grades in his class not becauyse his tests are hard it's because he gives the test on it today and teaches it tommorrow. 

LordBen wanders of muttering about the C+ he has in the class and the A's he has in every other class.

He kept me off the high honor roll the idiot.


P.S. I'm not joking about this eighther he really is this bad.

P.P.S. I lied about all A's I got a B in spelling  should have got worse, but it was multiple choice if it wasn't I would have failed spelling
