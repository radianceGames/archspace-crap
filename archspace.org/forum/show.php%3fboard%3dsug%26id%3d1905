			  			I am addressing only the Blockading of low ranked players by others @ 200% of their power solely for the purpose of gaining XP for the higher ranked players commanders.  <br />
<br />
I AM NOT ADDRESSING SIEGING IN A WAR - that's something else.<br />
<br />
This rule penalises newbies/lowbies at no real cost the attacker. I know the perpetrators get lowered honour when attacking, but anyone can live with honour 1 atm - the increased chance of bad events is just not enough of a deterrent.<br />
<br />
There are a few issues issues - remember we are only addressing attacking low rankers for commie XP.<br />
<br />
Atm a player can be blocked, defleeted and then blocked blocked blocked until 50% of his planets are useless for 12 hours. That gives no chance for the defending player to rebuild a defence fleet. I propose that there can only be one SUCCESSFUL block on any one player per 24 hours.<br />
<br />
The penalty for blocking a player at 50% of your power should be increased - hugely.<br />
Firstly I think there should be an instant bad event - maybe  a version of Traitorous commander whereby a commie leaves in disgust at your dishonourable behaviour or whatever (suggestions please :) )<br />
Secondly your lowered honour should have worse consequences than they do now. ATM low honour is (apparently) supposed to give a higher |% chance of bad events at the event tick, but speaking on IRC to some of the vets, it seems that there just aren't enough bad events happening. Maybe there is a need for more, or maybe there is a need for a higher % chance for them to happen. I think a player with honour of less than 10 should have a 100% chance of a bad event every single day.<br />
<br />
Bad events need to be updated. Looking at the OOA data, all I can see is 9 or 10 bad events, most of which are, to most players, only a minor irritation. Interstellar dust cloud is only of concern to those with NRL, lowered empire relations can be fixed with a bribe, Mass hysteria results (I had this) seems to result in the loss of about 30% of your buildings on one planet. Compare bad with good - silicon insect swarm, discover of new resources - both raise the planet type by 1 level.<br />
<br />
Conversely, the reward for high honour needs to be increased in order for people to have more of an incentive for achieving high honour. There is a player on our council who is Saintly. When I tell players that, they laugh and ask WHY? As much as bod honour should result in more bad events, then high honour should result in good events. If a player has 90%+ honour they should be guaranteed a good event every day. I can see a whole change in the style of play if people think they are more likely to get a silicon insect swarm with high honour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, and this is a rhetorical question, why is  it that when players attack for XP they ALWAYS attack the UR  or R they can see, when they get the same XP for blocking a poor ? Not content with  defleeting people these ***** just want to rub salt into a wound &quot;Because they can&quot;.<br />
