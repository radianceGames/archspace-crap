						  Message:<br><textarea name="msg"  cols="50" rows="20">Blockading out of council war or war should be banned with another option called scout be in place. Scout should only allow 2 ships and they run as soon as they see all of the ships in the battle. If it gets destroyed, it transmitts is findings back home and you get to see their fleet format and whether they are doomies or not. 

___ Your scout idea is the dumbest thing i've ever heard and blockades shall stay, make a good council and no one will try and block you___
___ Do you have a better idea?___
__let it be the way it is.. no one is complaining but you__
___actually lots of people have complained-check other forums as well as this one and back up your arguments___

The protection limit should be turned up. When I had 40 planets, I had someone come and rape my down to 2. TWO! From 2 planets, you really can't do anything and might as well die. 

___protection takes effect when 70% of ur planets are taken, mayeb they declared total war, you attacked back when u were in protection or the server crashed, suck it up, ive died many times and made a good comeback___
___no total war, haven't died once but always have been getting toasted but surviving just___
__Suck it up, it happens to all of us.__
___Thats why it should be changed___

The restrictions are stuffed for councils attacking one another. It should be like that the most powerful person in the council that is declaring war be either 50% more weaker or 20% more powerful so if you want to suicide, so be it. 

___that's the dumbest fucking thing ever___
___now, now. don't swear you fucking bastard___
__thats just retarded and you are a hipocrite__
___HYPOCRITE dumbass___

Now to my dodgy tricks. You can go to rankings and fleet and find all of these defleeted people. If you want to find a defleeted council, go to council fleet. This is great when you are in a one person council and want to toast another one person council. 

___thats retarded, kind of like you maybe___
___it works. how many planets have you had altogether over this round?___
__a whole lot more than you__
___how much___

If you find someone with a big number, see how fleets they have by going to war|blockade check. You don't have to attack the person but you get free information on fleets. If someone has a weak powerlevel and piles of fleets, chances are that they are raper fleets. 

___thats stupid, that's just making something just for you__
___this works too. i have had roughly 400 planets over this entire round and i don't even play every single minute of every day so SUCK!___

Yeah.. want to give me you're player number?
___all right, #128___ 
Kick my ass, i don't care i got 3 planets<p><br>---------------------------------------
