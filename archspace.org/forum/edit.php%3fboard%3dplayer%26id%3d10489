So, I guess it's time to bring you guys up to date on my prick of a roommate, who currently is whining to his mom on the phone (AGAIN). Chemistry today was quite boring (we did stuff that I had had in Physics - ie, heat change), so I wrote a resolution. And here it is:

Resolution supporting the removal of Luke Burton from the Cate Academic Arts Community, specifically the Brooks 4 hall.

Whereas: Luke Burton is not an integral member of the Honors Dorm or the University of Oklahoma housing as a whole; and,

Whereas: He has been an irritating roommate as:
1) He has kept his roommate (Matthew) awake on numerous evenings before Matthew's 7:30 AM lab;
2) He attempts to sabotage any of Matthew's efforts to live a normal college life;
3) He bothers Matthew when:
    a) Matthew is doing his homework,
    b) Matthew is playing on the computer, and
    c) Matthew is doing various other activities  too numerous to mention;
4) He constantly turns on the overhead light, without regard to Matthew's state or to the ambient light from the windows;
5) He consistantly wakes Matthew up on days when Matthew has no early classes by:
    a) continuous loud closing of te dorm door,
    b) loud clunking of various objects such as cereal bowls and refrigerator doors;
6) He has filled Matthew's refrigerator with numerous cartons of milk, so that Matthew cannot keep any food items he wants; and
7) He has erased Matthew's marker board on various occasions (violating Matthew's Constitutional rights, as given to him by the First Amendment), as he did not like what had been written; and,

Whereas: He is not liked by a majority of the members of the Brooks 4 hall, as:
1) He is extremely conservative and is easily offended;
2) He disrupts conversations with his viewpoints; and
3) He is arrogant and assumes that everyone on the hall needs his help; and,

Whereas: He is completely unaware of anything he has done to annoy the members of Brooks 4 and the other members of the Cate Academic Arts Community; thus

We resolve that:
1) Luke Burton be removed from Brooks 4;
2) Luke Burton be prohibited from ever entering Brooks 4; and
3) Luke Burton be blacklisted and never allowed to serve as a resident advisor at the University of Oklahoma.

Signed,
Matthew and the other members of the Cate Academic Arts Community</textarea><p></p>
