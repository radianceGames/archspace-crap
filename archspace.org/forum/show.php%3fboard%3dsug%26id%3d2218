			  			Archspace is getting annoying. I had this freak, come out of the blue and blockaded me and wiped my puny ass all over the floor so the guy who I was raping raped me back and got 13 extra planets out of the bargain.<br />
<br />
Blockading out of council war or war should be banned with another option called scout be in place. Scout should only allow 2 ships and they run as soon as they see all of the ships in the battle. If it gets destroyed, it transmitts is findings back home and you get to see their fleet format and whether they are doomies or not. <br />
<br />
The protection limit should be turned up. When I had 40 planets, I had someone come and rape my down to 2. TWO! From 2 planets, you really can't do anything and might as well die. <br />
<br />
The restrictions are stuffed for councils attacking one another. It should be like that the most powerful person in the council that is declaring  war be either 50% more weaker or 20% more powerful so if you want to suicide, so be it.  <br />
<br />
Now to my dodgy tricks. You can go to rankings and fleet and find all of these defleeted people. If you want to find a defleeted council, go to council fleet. This is great when you are in a one person council and want to toast another one person council. <br />
<br />
If you find someone with a big number, see how fleets they have by going to war|blockade check. You don't have to attack the person but you get free information on fleets. If someone has a weak powerlevel and piles of fleets, chances are that they are raper fleets. <br />
<br />
If you already know all of these dodgy tricks, don't bother saying how dumb I am.<br />

			  	HAHAHA DESTROYER YOU NOOB....   ima have to agree with BAO on this one,   i just have to say your a twat, and cant play...  if you cant protect the planets you have, your just asking to be raped...<br />
<br />
You will be fine if you knew how to play....  i think you just get 40 planets from defleeted people sending 2 cruisers a pop, thus your 80 cruisers and 40 planets = a power of 40 dooms and 15 planets...<br />
<br />
Who's going to win??? i mean really....  use your head...  you gradually get more planets as you need them...   you will usually know by looking at the peeps in your rank range, and seeing how many planets they have...  i like to stay 1 or 2 under them, it keeps me a less target...<br />
<br />
and ill tell you somthing...  i blockade peeps with 40 planets and my power range cause they have less ships them me.. so i know i will win,  where as i debate to blockade someone with 6 planets my power, but i do and 1/2 of them i win cause there not dooms, this is because there too little planets to mass produce them...  and those are just other noobers....  like your self...  haha i forgot why i wanted to reply.... and what this is about :S:S    ---somthing like BAO YOUR RIGHT!!! OTHER GUY YOUR WRONG!!!---			   <P align=right></P>

			  	this is why i try not to post coz you say something and everybody is like &quot;you're a Noob and suck.&quot; i've played this game since the mari days.<br />
<br />
blockading is a cheap tactic, a lot of people don't like it, thats why it has been changed.  i don't take more planets then i think i can hold. take a planet, then build more ships to hold it before going to the next one. but when somebody twice the power of you comes at you there is nothing you can do. a friend of mine had nothing but dooms with HBH. then some shitfucker blockaded with twice as many then accused him of fluffing. seriously screw that. you have 100 dooms then someone with twice the power therefore twice the dooms comes and wipes them all out?			   <P align=right></P>
