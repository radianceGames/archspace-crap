            <P>"...It was believed until now that the Empire, which took 3000 
              years to fall into decline, would take another 3000 years to complete 
              its downfall. Technology was slowly taking a step backward, but 
              travel at the speed of light was still remembered. Though the Empire's 
              reins were becoming lax over its outer colonies, the Empire still 
              possessed the ability to exercise control and influence over its 
              realms. In the central controls of each planet, there were directors 
              who still carried out the Emperor's wishes, and the center of the 
              Empire, which contained the Imperial Palace, was firmly under the 
              control of the Empire. Those who dared to challenge the Empire faced 
              the wrath of the Imperial Armada, which still retained its fame 
              and might. The League of Supremacy, established as an alliance between 
              the different species of the galaxy, also had quite a bit of success 
              in mediating differences between outer colonies and the Empire." 
            </P>
            <P> "The regression and slow decline of the Empire, which was gnawing 
              away at its power like a virus, could be considered a massive tragedy 
              when each individual battle is considered. But viewing this decay 
              from a comprehensive viewpoint, the internal conflicts, and the 
              devastation and ruin that resulted from these conflicts, can be 
              seen as quite normal on the whole time line. It even became a trend 
              among historians to calculate when the "last emperor" would reign, 
              and when that reign would end. Like the doctor who calculates the 
              time of death for a patient who looks fine but is battling a deadly 
              disease and is slowly withering away..." </P>
            <P> "It was then that a historic event occurred, an event never before 
              seen in the entire history of all the empires that had enjoyed hegemony 
              throughout the flow of time in the galaxy. 3 species from distant 
              galaxies sought refuge in the Empire's galaxy. They did not directly 
              challenge the rule of the Empire, but they settled without permission 
              on many planets. The Empire showed hesitation in acting against 
              these refugees." </P>
            <P>"The three species called Xeloss, Xerusian, and Xesperados boldly 
              shook the still equilibrium of the galaxy and interrupted the quiet 
              decline of the Empire. Having left their home galaxy for foreign 
              lands, these species were brimming with energy to change and create 
              new cultures. This became the catalyst for outer planets that had 
              sought to break away from the Empire. Unfortunately, these species, 
              which had already been rivals in their own galaxies, also brought 
              with them the fire of battle..." </P>
