<u><font face="OCR A Extended" color="#00FF00">ArchSpace Guide</font></u>

<font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
by Wonder Bee a.k.a. Nick Bennett</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">INTRO:<br>
Alright folks, I have been getting a bunch of ICQ messages from players (newbies)
who have a lot of questions about Archspace. Now I am going to go through this
fairly quick so don't bitch about spelling or grammer. I'm a math/
Telecommunications major and so I don't worry about my English capabilities.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Choosing a Race:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Alright, some of you have ask about racial modifiers and best charractors, below
is a listing of each races modifiers and a brief explaination of them:</font></p>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Agerus Military +4,
Commerce -3, Diplomacy-3<br>
Bosalians Military -2, Diplomacy+4<br>
Buckaneer Military -2, Commerce +3<br>
Evintos Diplomacy -2, Effeciency +3, Research -2<br>
Human Enviroment -1, Growth +2, Effeciency -1, Genius+2<br>
Targoid Faculity Cost +4, Research-1, Growth +2, Prouduction+2<br>
Tecanoids Environment +2, Spy +2<br>
Xeloss Military +2, Diplomacy -2<br>
Xerusian Efficiency -2<br>
Xesperados Genius +3, Facility Cost -5, Spy -3, Research +2</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">All right, now these are
all right as far as I can remember (servers down so I can't check). Now I will
attempt to describe what all these mean.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Military = How fast you
can build ships<br>
Commerce = How much money is made through trade (I'll explain more later)<br>
Enviroment = How fast it takes you to terraform<br>
Effeciency = how fast you can build new building ig: Factory's, Military bases<br>
Growth = How fast your population grows<br>
Prouduction = How much money each of your factory's and bases put out<br>
Faculty Cost = How much you'll have to pay in upkeep for your building<br>
Spy = How often your spy mission will work<br>
Genious = How much Exp. your commanders get from battle<br>
Diplomacy = I think it has to do with the empire but I'm not sure<br>
Research = How fast you can research</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now, when you choose a
race, you should choose one that will be good in the long run, as you can see
Targoids have good bonuses in Faculty Cost, Growth and production. Now what this
enables you to do is grow very quickly and therefore your able to recover from
loses of planets faster.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">No one race is dominant
in the game, however as of now you see a lot of people as Targoids for the
reasons listed above. I myself am Xerusian because I thought the Description was
cool :-P</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Key Terms:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now here I will discuss
some of the terms I may use throughout this little guide that some people may
not know. If you do know then skip past this part.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Terraforming = Changing
your planet from Unsuitable to Suitable.<br>
a. Now when you get a new planet from either expeditions or sieges, you will
have to terraform this planet, unless you attacked the same race as you. That is
the smart thing to do when first starting out.<br>
b. Now to speed up terraforming there are only two things you can do, Invest in
the planet or Get higher tech's</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">PP= PP is what your
factory's give you each turn, the more factory's you have the more PP you get on
that planet.<br>
a. Check planet descriptions on next topic to find out more.<br>
MP= MP is what your Military bases give you per turn, your MP takes care of
fleet missions and Ship upkeep. If you exceed your MP per turn with expenses
then you will make up the difference with PP. You pay 20 PP per 1MP you are
over.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Commerce =As stated
above commerce is your trade money you make per turn. You make this through
relations through your planets and allied planets.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Waste Ratio = Now this
is the one that people get pissed at, Waste Ratio effects your planet
production. E.g.: if you have 50% waste then 50% of your production is
disregarded and you only make 50% of what you would without waste. Each race has
a different planet max without waste. This means that as a Xerusian I can have
20 planets with 0 waste and every planet I get past 20 has 2-3% waste added to
it.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Sortie = When your
fleets are on there way back from a cancelled mission</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Planets:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Planets range from Ultra
Poor to Ultra Rich. Here is the list of different planets</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Ultra Poor= Very poor PP
production and slow building rates<br>
Poor= A little better than UP's but still not very good<br>
Normal= as the name says Normal<br>
Rich= Gives you less than UR's do but more than Normals in PP<br>
Ultra Rich= Gives you more PP per turn due to good resources</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Sizes range as follows:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Tiny<br>
Small<br>
Normal<br>
Large<br>
Huge</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Planet Modifiers:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now planet modifiers are
modifiers on the planet that increase a certain aspect of the planet. I have
listed them below:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Volcanic Activity
Production +2<br>
<br>
Artifact Research +10</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Huge Artifact Research
+20</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Black Hole Commerce -2</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Asteroid Production +1<br>
<br>
Major Space Route Commerce +2</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Ocean Growth +3<br>
Faculty cost -2</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Frontier Area Commerce
-2</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Moon Military +2<br>

All right, Now I realize that a few of these may be wrong but 97% of them are
right. I did these on my own so don't bitch.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now, a few of these you
can destroy or get rid of with techs. I can't remember which tech's, but don't
worry you'll figure it out. The ones you can get rid of are Sever Radiation,
Irregular Climate, Obstinate Microbe, and Hostile Monster. Like I said there may
be more but you can figure them out.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now a good strategy for
planets is this, you want Normals and higher with good production modifiers on
them for your planets with little or now waste, once you start to get high waste
you want planets with high commerce modifiers. Even if the planet is Ultra Poor
but has good commerce modifiers take it. I myself with 100+ planets only take
them with high commerce mods, I have a lot of UP's with 90% waste that give me
250,000 PP per turn through commerce. As you will find out that's very good.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Buildings:<br>
*note, if you have a modifier from one of the above you will be able to grow in
that area by building more of that area. What that means is if you have a Huge
artifact which is +20 on research, you will be able to build research labs
really fast on that planet. Keep that in mind for the next section.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now everyone has a
different opinion on what do build on what type of planets. I myself like to do
this.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Low waste and good
planets such as Normal, Rich or Ultra Rich, I like to build mostly factory's, I
set the ratio from anywhere to 70% Factory's 30% military bases to 90%
Factory's. I set 100% factories on my big money makes though.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">One my poor and ultra
poors that I get stuck with in my low waste rate area I like to build mostly
military bases. This is because they won't produce much PP and so instead of
having them go to waste I gain some MP from them.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">There is a limit to how
many building can be on each planet, now I'm not sure of the exact number, but I
do know it depends on the size and it's resources. For a Normal Normal I thinks
it's somewhere between 1200-1500 buildings, so watch what you build.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">As stated above
Factory's give you PP that's your money that you can spend, you can invest this
into anything from Planets to Researching to Shipbuilding. When you invest into
something it speeds it up about 40% so it's a good thing to do.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Military bases give you
MP with will take care of upkeep on ships you have in fleets and protect your
planets from raids.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Research Labs speed up
the time it takes to research a tech. You gain RP with this, but don't worry
about it you don't need it once done researching.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Concentration Mode:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">This is the mode that
you can set, you can choose from:<br>
Industry, which will give you more PP per turn and buildings seem to go up
faster<br>
Research, which most people are in to start the game<br>
Military, which will invest more money into ship building which will speed that
up<br>
Balanced which will be an all around setting.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Researching:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">When you start to
research, you want to make sure you are building mostly research labs on your
planets and also make sure you keep investing into it, this will speed it up.
Most people like to be in research mode when they start the game because it's
really a race to finish it. While researching however you want to make sure you
are in free research because if you single out a specific tech you want it will
take twice as long. Only single one out if it's one of your last important
techs. Other than that it's like anything else just research!</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Projects:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Now there are projects that you will be able to buy with a certain level of
tech's, these projects will modify your racial modifiers discussed above. It
tells you how it's going to modify it before you buy it. It's a good idea to
wait to buy the projects that hurt your researching until you are done
researching.There are also council projects that will help you even more.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">One note I should add on
projects, you need the project galactic something of free commerce before you
can star t getting commerce...sorry I forgot to add that earlier.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">To see what your
modifiers are you can check anytime by going to Domestic main then at the bottom
you'll see White book here you can see what your planet modifiers are and your
racial modifier.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Attacking/Battles:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Your options for
attacking are as follows:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Raiding: when you raid
you send 1 fleet to a person's planet and destroy building on it. If he has
military bases on it then you will need to destroy all of them before being able
to hit any factory's (this is why you want to watch when you build 100%
factory's)</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Pirating: this will send
1 fleet in to a persons planet to pillage for money, you usually don't get much
so it's just good for gaining EXP for your commanders.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Blockade: This is where
you send your full armada (all your fleets) to a person's planet to fight his
armada (All his fleets)<br>
* Note that with the above three you do not need to be at war with someone</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Sieging: This is where
you send in your fleets to take a planet from someone...You need to be at war
with them for this option to work.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Allied fleets: You can
send any of your allies your fleets by going to mission and dispatch too, you
must be allied to them however. Once you send him your fleets they will help him
protect his planets. As of right now there is a bug, which makes allied fleets
invincible. This only happens when the other person has no fleets of his own and
the only one defending the planet are allied. You can kill them but they come
back from the dead.... Ooohhhhh scary ;-)</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">If someone is raiding
you, you will not be able to know who it is unless you station fleets on the
planets he's raiding. Same goes for Pirating!</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Stationing fleets on
your planets is a great idea once you are strong enough to build decent fleet at
a fast rate, what this will do is protect you from being raped while you are
defenseless. I'll discuss this later.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Commanders:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
You gain Exp.: for your commanders with every mission you send them one, with
raids they get 1000, with blockades they get more and with sieges they get even
more, the max level for a commander is level 20 and with every level they go up
the more ships they can command. Not much more to ad on commanders, each race's
commanders have different abilities so I don't know them all. I do know that
since Xerusian have a +5 Morale their commanders stay and fight even with the
&quot;Mother Ship&quot; is destroyed.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">War:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Only the speaker of a
council can declare war on another council, the only thing you can do is declare
war with someone within your council, you do this by going to diplomacy and send
message, then you just select the type of message as declare war.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now once you feel you
have won the war, you can send one of the three messages:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Suggest Truce: Usually
when your losing you send this;-) sometimes just to be nice</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Demand truce: this makes
the person give you money if he accepts it, it's like 60% of what he has</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Demand submission: this
makes him give you 90-100% of the money he has.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now when I say money he
has, I am referring to what the single person has, if this is a council message
then it's referring to whats in the council safe.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Not much else to say
about war, can't give everything away!</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Ships:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
You build ships and when a ship is build it's put into the pool, I'll discuss
this in a min...you can lower the time it takes you to build ships by increasing
the amount of money you make per turn. You do this by building factory's. Don't
forget once you fleet these ships you will need MP to keep them.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Now when you go to ship
building you'll see something like this</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Max PP per turn
7,548,543<br>
Ivested PP left 350,000,000</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">PP in Pool 22,344,543</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Alright now I'll explain
what these mean:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Max PP per turn is the
amount of money that is going into building your ships per tuen, when you have
invested money in it it goes a lot higher:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Invested PP left means
thats how much money you have left from what you invested into ship building</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">PP in ship pool is how
much money has been spent on building a certian ship eg: you see right now it's
at 22,344,543 that means that I'm building a DoomStar and it is almost done
because Dooms take 23,716,000. So when it get's to 23,716,000 my doom star will
be done and it will start to build the next one.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">I'm not going to give
you any ship designs because you need to learn that on your own.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Ship pool:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">When you have buildt a
ship it goes into the pool, and you can form fleets with these ships that are in
the pool. So if I have 47 DoomStars of the same design I can put them into a
fleet. You can only put ships of the same design in a fleet...Sorry.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">You can later upgrade
these fleets by going under the Fleet option and selection resignment. First of
all your ships need to be in the stand by mode, which means they are not on a
mission. Once you have selected resignment you can either add or remove ships or
if you can replace all the ships with a different class and design.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">not much else to say
about ship pool.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
A few Stratgies:</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00"><br>
Planet Grabbers: These are ships that you use for the purpose of grabbing
planets fast when someone dosen't have any ships defending himself. The consist
of usually 4-6 gunboats per fleet. I like to keep 30 grabbers at all time and I
station them on my home planet so they don't get destroyed in an attack. This is
also a good way to get EXp for your commanders, because they gain EXP with every
seige they do.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Stationed fleets: I like
to station 1 fleet on every one of my planets, however since I can't afford the
upkeep of 200 fleets I usually only station them on planets peolple would want.
I do this because if you become defenseless you are open to get raped (all you
planets taken) and if your going against a decent council you will get raped. I
station usually dreads because planet grabbers are usually gun boats you fleet
of dreads will fight them off and make the person seiging you use a good fleet
and that take a while for them to retun....you have a fighting chance of
survival that way.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Fluffing: This is
dangours but sometimes nessacery. Fluffing means false power, you get this by
building mass guboats and keeping them in your pool. This will inflate your
power and you can either hide from people or jump up to hit them. I do it at
times becasue it gives you options. I have to high of power to do it now, but if
you are in the 50K to 200K range it can work for you. If you keep a fluffed
power then you can hit people and if you are losing you can deflate so they
can't hit you, or you can fluff up higher to avoid getting hit.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">Well, I think this
should be able to help most newbies out, I covered most of the things you need
to get started. There is too much stratigie in this game for me to give out and
plus some things you need to learn on your own. Hope you enjoyed.</font>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended" size="1" color="#00FF00">p.s. When the server is
down all the time it gives me time to do things like this ;-)</font>
